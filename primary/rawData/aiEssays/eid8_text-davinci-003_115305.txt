I remember the first time we truly laughed together. We had been dating for a couple months, but it was always very serious. We hadn't fully connected yet. 

One night, we were having dinner and one of us said something funny. We both started giggling, and before we could stop, we were both laughing hysterically. We laughed so hard, tears were flowing down our faces. 

In that moment, I realized how much I loved being with this person. I felt like we had formed a real bond. We talked about the stupid joke and laughed about it all night. 

From that day forward, laughter was a huge part of our relationship. We would giggle over dinner, make funny jokes, and sometimes just laugh about nothing at all. 

Laughter was the thing that brought us closer together. It gave us a way to connect on a deeper level and showed us how in tune our senses of humor were. 

Laughter will always be an essential part of our relationship, and I'm thankful to have found someone to laugh with.
