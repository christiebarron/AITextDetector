The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The only way to get a dirigible to dock into the building would have to have an engine. In one instance of the Empire State Building, the engines of Flightman and B-17s used to run off the back side of the aircraft. In other cases, the engine had to be manually operated by someone onboard.

The DRAFT Document Project (D.A.P.) is an example of the complexity of the problem. To be fair to most DRAFT contributors, they aren't particularly knowledgeable about itâ€”and it's not an exhaustive answer. What you probably don't know is that it can be done on a computer-based system.

The DRAFT Document Project could be more than just a tool for making sure you never need a dirigible. It could also be a tool to help to develop more advanced systems that would require some form of navigation and some sort of navigational gear.
