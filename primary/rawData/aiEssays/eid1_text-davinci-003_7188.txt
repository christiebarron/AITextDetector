In Joe Kurmaski's poem 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist is traveling through the setting of a ruggedly beautiful landscape of the northern Cascade Mountains. The cyclist is put in an environment where he must ascend through a dangerous and intimidating terrain, which provides a unique and powerful backdrop for his trial and journey of self-discovery. 

The features of the setting establish a sense of tension throughout the cyclist's journey as the environment is constantly testing both his physical and mental limits. For example, the “juxtaposed boulders” highlights the inherent risks associated with mountain biking. The dense, difficult terrain leaves the cyclist with little room for error and begs the question of whether or not he has the nerve and strength to complete the journey. 

The setting also provides a source of hope and inspiration for the cyclist. As he “climb[s] toward open sky,”this allows the cyclist to better appreciate the beauty of the Cascade Mountains and it gives him the motivation to keep going despite how physically and mentally grueling the climb can be. 

Furthermore, the environment serves as an allegory for the struggles and obstacles faced throughout life, and the cyclist’s ability to fight through these obstacles and yield to the pressure of the environment displays the strength of his character. The setting, then, displays both the risks and potential of the cyclist, and it also provides insight into the struggles and successes of the cyclist as he progresses
