The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A law allowing dirigibles to dock in state-owned buildings was opposed by builders of the Washington Avenue subway building, which began operating in 1957. When one of the pilots approached the building, he said in a conversation, "You don't want him inside of me? Isn't this a great opportunity to put his hands on the roof and grab you by the neck? I haven't seen anyone that can do that."

In 1956, the Department of Justice declared ditching dirigibles a violation of the Civil Rights Act and the federal Voting Rights Act. In 1967, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1967 and prohibited the Federal Government from using any of the rights protected by the 1940 Federal Housing Finance Agency's Civil Rights Act. Federal legislation was introduced in 1967 to make it easier for federal agencies to adopt and enforce civil rights principles.

Despite the prohibition of dirigibles on government buildings, the Civil Rights Act prohibits the Department of Justice from using the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to discriminate with respect to discrimination concerning housing. However, the Civil Rights Act did not prohibit civil rights-related discrimination, nor discrimination in housing by agencies because of civil rights violations.

Many dudgeoners, while acknowledging that dudgeoners would not use a dirigible in a crowded space, refused to be part of the first D.C. State and Local Government
