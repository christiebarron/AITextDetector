The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The "backwards-looking" tower of the Empire State Building in New York City was already undergoing renovation as part of the demolition of a proposed project that had not been completed. Now that the demolition had been carried out, however, the Empire State building's curved edge was no longer a "backwards-looking" wall. Instead, it was a large white wall which looked more like a curved-dividing rectangle.

The first obstacle to the Empire State Building was a combination of bad design and demolition. On one level, an old steel structure on the first floor had been demolished after numerous attempts to install panels removed and re-fabricated to meet the need. On the other the building was in need of a new stand for the building's interior. The Empire State Building's exterior had no structural integrity, and any possible damage or collapse was quickly resolved with new concrete. At the same time, there still remained a small gap where two large metal rails converged behind the structure. Some of these rails, however, appeared to have been a problem because the current structural integrity of the building had been compromised.

The new steel columns and slats also allowed construction to be completed more quickly. However, while the facade on the building was now in the condition required to support the building, they did not fully conform to the required minimum specifications. A further problem, however, was
