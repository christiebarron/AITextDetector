The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 represented a massive leap forward in modern architecture. It was one of the most ambitious projects of its time and also the first skyscraper to include a feature that had never been tried before – an area designed specifically for the mooring of large airships to dock at the building’s upper area. Despite the grand vision of such a feat, and the innovative design that followed, the realization of this goal was plagued with obstacles that stemmed from how new and unprecedented this idea was at the time. 

The initial hurdle was the problem of creating a suitable dock for the airships. Since nothing of this scale had been undertaken before, the engineering challenge was significant. It was decided that the 78th floor of the building should house the mooring mast and a landing deck, and to provide further stability two 400-foot masts were also constructed outside the building. 

The next challenge was providing a safe environment for the airships to dock. The mooring mast was designed with a self-supporting steel mast with a receiving bar in the center of each 100-foot section. It was also equipped with braking and holding systems, and anti-ramming guiderails. The safety was further enhanced by the use of specially designed rubberized buffers designed to further protect the mooring mast from accidental contact and bumps caused by strong winds. 

Finally, the problem of access had to be addressed.
