Once while I was out shopping, I accidentally bumped into someone with my cart. When I apologized, the woman told me it was alright but she refused to take my apology at face value. She asked me to sit with her for a few hours and have a conversation. I was a bit taken aback. I had so many other errands to run and I had not expected this.

But I was determined to keep my cool. After all, I had been the one at fault for bumping into her. So, I put aside all my other plans and I sat down and talked with her.

We ended up talking for over two hours. She had so much to share and I was genuinely interested in learning more. I listened intently to all of her stories and asked a lot of thoughtful questions.

It was then I realized how important it was to be patient. I had the urge to rush off and finish my errands, but it was so worth it to sit with this woman and have a real conversation. It was a reminder that life is about more than just finishing tasks, but connecting with people and hearing what they have to say.
