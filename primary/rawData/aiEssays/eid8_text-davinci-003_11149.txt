I recall the day my daughter and I had our first laugh together fondly. We had been trying to build a tower out of blocks for what seemed like ages but nothing seemed to stand for more than a few seconds no matter how hard we tried.

We stopped our attempts and sat back, both of us staring at the ruins of our tower and feeling dejected. Then suddenly, my daughter looked up at me with a mischievous grin and put together the two remaining blocks just-so and yelled, “Ta-da!” 

I couldn't help but chuckle — it was such a silly gesture but so full of joy. We both burst into laughter and kept on laughing until our stomachs ached. We had that day built a tower of laughter instead of blocks.

Ever since, every time I look at my daughter, I get that same feeling of joy and laughter. It reminds me that a few moments of laughter can break down barriers and build a connection between two people that will last forever.
