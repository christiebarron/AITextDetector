Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people. In today's world, computers have become an essential part of everyone's life. They are used for communicating, storing data, obtaining knowledge, and even creating new innovative products and services.

All of this, however, comes with a price: an increased dependence on computers, which can lead to negative consequences. People's reliance on computers has paved the way for a diminished sense of creativity and problem-solving skills, as well as a disconnect from reality. The use of computers causes users to become overly reliant on them, which diminishes their capacity to think critically and come up with creative solutions. Additionally, having all the answers at one's fingertips can lead to an unrealistic sense of knowledge and a feeling of total autonomy.

Ultimately, using computers in our everyday lives can be very beneficial, but it is essential to remember to take breaks from them and to stay current with the skills necessary to be able to think independently. Computers are amazing tools, but we must not let them become a crutch to rely on for all of our life decisions.

Therefore, I believe that computers should not be used heavily, but instead, used as a tool to help facilitate other ways of learning. In this way, we can reap the benefits of computers yet still stay balanced and in touch with reality.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
