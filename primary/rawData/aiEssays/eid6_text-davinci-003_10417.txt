The Empire State Building is known as one of the most iconic landmarks in American history and it was designed with the idea of allowing dirigibles, or large airships, to dock at the mast on the top of the building. The idea of having airships dock at the building first came up in 1924 and the plans was that a high mooring mast would be installed on top of the building. Despite the exciting concept, there were a number of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First, the location of the mooring mast was a major issue. In order to be effective, the mooring mast needed to be in the center of the building, as airships needed to be fully stabilized while docking. However, the Empire State Building's infrastructure doesn't have a center point, making it difficult to determine where the mast should be located.  Furthermore, the mast needed to be secured firmly to the building. However, the Empire State Building was designed as a steel frame with no solid foundation on the top, making it difficult to securely install a mooring mast.

Another obstacle was the size of the mooring mast. Dirigibles had to be at least 200 feet in the air when docking, and the mast had to be much taller than this. This led to further complications as the mooring mast needed to be built with a strong material, such as steel or reinforced concrete
