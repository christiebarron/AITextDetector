The Empire State Building was an ambitious project from its conception to its completion. One unique feature was the placement of a mast at the top of the building that was intended to be used as a docking station for airships called dirigibles. However, once the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, the many obstacles involved in allowing such a dangerous undertaking as docking large airships presented too great of a risk. Thus, the dirigible mooring mast was never used as originally intended.

When the Empire State Building was first conceived, the intention was to use a single, permanent mast to serve the purpose of docking. This mast was to be 206 feet tall and situated at the highest point of the building. This was to provide a stable base from which dirigibles could dock, supplying passengers and freight to the bustling city of New York. Unfortunately, the mast was installed at an angle, which meant it couldnâ€™t be used to its original intent.

The next problem that presented itself was the power required to winch the large airships to the top of the building. This would require more energy than the building could provide, and would have been difficult to maintain as the airship traffic expanded. Moreover, the process of winching the ships up was dangerous and could easily lead to accidents.

The final hurdle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the fact that the mooring operation had to be done manually at the
