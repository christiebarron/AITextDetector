One of these purposes was the safe docking of dirigible vessels, which would have allowed passengers to travel in a unique and incomparable fashion. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to successfully dock. 

A primary obstacle was the thickness of the mast that was to be used for mooring the dirigible as outlined in the book, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. Unlike traditional masts which are made as thin as possible, the mast for the Empire State Building was made substantially thicker than usual. In order to safely moor the dirigible, the mast needed an extra-wide base to add stability and durability. This meant that the mast was much more expensive than traditional ones, making it harder for the budget to accommodate the cost.

Another obstacle discussed in Lüsted’s book was the wind factor. Being situated in New York City, the Empire State Building was much higher and closer to the surrounding skyscrapers than most dirigible landings. This meant that cross winds posed a higher risk for the dirigible. Winds would have deflected off the skyscrapers and collided with the dirigible, making it difficult for it to dock safely. To combat these winds, engineers invented a system of guide wires and trusses. This system was first used in 1924 by
