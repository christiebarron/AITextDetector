The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building's original design, by Paul Graham, had a double-layer building, which included two decks, to support a single aircraft. According to Mr. Graham, "The main attraction in getting it to float, the main feature of getting it to climb or to descend, was the very fact that the second landing pad was built at that plane altitude with all the other planes flying back and forth between the two decks."

The first landing pad was located a few yards away from the landing gear, on a bluff called Laddell Lane. A second pad existed on the north end of the building. A third landing pad on what is now Rufus Pass had some kind of landing gear. This was much further behind the plane deck, and a landing gear from that was much closer to the upper deck, so the first one landed far away from the plane's wings, making possible the first landing. The second landing pad, also adjacent to the second deck, was much farther down. The final landing pad on Laddell Lane was about three yards from the landing gear.

The last landing pad was to the left of the bridge, along a hill called Wall Road. While some of the water in this area was used for construction in the second phase of the Empire State Building, it was not used during the first Phase.
