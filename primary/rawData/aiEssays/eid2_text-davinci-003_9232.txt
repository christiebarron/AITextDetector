In an age of advancing technological limitations and increasing restrictions on expression, censorship of libraries should remain a controversial issue. It is an issue of civil rights, freedom of expression, and access to information. With the prevalence of internet censorship, libraries remain one of the few public spaces that offer unrestricted access to knowledge and freedom of expression. It is therefore our responsibility to ensure that our library is a place of open conversation and thought.

In my opinion, restricting access to certain materials on the basis of offense is unjust and unnecessary. Libraries contain a wide variety of materials; while some might be considered offensive by certain people, others may find these materials valuable sources of knowledge. It is not the library's responsibility to evaluate the material on the basis of its content and restrict access. Therefore, removing materials from the shelves if they are found offensive would limit access to knowledge and stifle free expression.

Furthermore, heavy censorship restricts the constitutional rights of adults. It is important to consider that these materials are available in other public spaces and can be accessed freely on the internet. If our library were to start censoring materials, it would only add to the existing issues of censorship and free speech.

To conclude, I believe that libraries should remain true to their purpose; they should continue to provide unrestricted access to knowledge and freedom of expression. The thought of censoring materials on the basis of offense should be rejected. Thus, books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed from the shelves
