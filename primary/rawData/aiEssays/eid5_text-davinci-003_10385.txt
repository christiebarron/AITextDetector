The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lifestyles, written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, was released in 2020. Within the memoir, Rodriguez intimately examines his upbringing and life in Newark, New Jersey—from his own roots to life with his family. The memoir is a personal reflection on family, identity, and how Rodriguez’s time in Newark—despite its poverty and crime— shaped him into the remarkable person he is today. 

The mood created in this memoir is reflective yet hopeful. Rodriguez reflects on both the obstacles he faced and his blessings, while finding gratitude for his Newark upbringing. This journey includes struggle and pain, such as Rodriguez’s witness to Newark’s decline, but also love and joy from his close relationships. Rodriguez holds much nostalgia for his childhood home. Though he does not shy away from discussing the city’s flaws, such as the crime and poverty, he remembers the beauty of the city—the parks, playful children, and lovely days.

When discussing his family, Rodriguez harbors tender moments that touch upon sadness and sweetness alike. He speaks particularly fondly of his mother's stalwart dedication and generosity to support him and his siblings. Additionally, Rodriguez celebrates the uniqueness of his family—from their Dominican heritage to their multigenerational history in Newark. He tells moments of tenderness within his parents' relationship, as well as joyous anecdotes of family gatherings.
