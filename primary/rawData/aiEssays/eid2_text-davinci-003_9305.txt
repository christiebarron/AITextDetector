Public libraries provide a wealth of knowledge and opportunity to their communities. While freedom of access to these resources must be maintained, censorship must also be considered in order to protect communities from offensive or inappropriate materials. 

When it comes to sensitive topics, libraries must be vigilant in their decisions on what materials should be allowed on the shelves. This is not only important in protecting the public from offensive or racist ideas, but also to protect vulnerable groups, such as children, from being exposed to potentially harmful materials. Many libraries also place restrictions on certain material, such as pornography, in order to maintain a family-friendly environment. 

Censorship in libraries must also be done in a legally responsible manner in order to avoid infringing on peopleâ€™s right to free expression. Libraries must balance their decisions carefully, taking into account the purpose of their library and the opinions of their community. If a complaint is raised about a particular book or magazine, libraries should act quickly by having a library committee make an informed decision about whether or not that material should be allowed on the shelves. 

Ultimately, libraries should be places of learning, discovery, and understanding. Allowing potentially dangerous or offensive materials can lead to a misguided understanding of culture or values, so it is important that libraries carefully consider what materials should be available to the public. While censorship is not always easy, it is necessary in order to maintain an environment that is safe and accepting of all individuals.
