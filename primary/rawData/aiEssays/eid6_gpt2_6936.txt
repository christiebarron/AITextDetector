The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The decision was made based on the public opinion that vehicles carrying passengers and cargo should have doors that could only access the center of the building at an elevation of 40 stories.

Many public opinion on this matter also swayed the government, who initially feared that the opening of the Empire State Building might lead to a massive explosion. After the bombing of the State Building on Sept. 11, 2001, officials decided to install four doors into the building: one into the upper level, two into the lower level; and two doors for the second floor and one for the third floor (this project was later eliminated by the Obama administration as an act of God). The doors went through the public's public support of all public projects. A group of high school students joined together at the University of Illinois to support a public meeting to oppose the doors.

The first of these doors was installed in 2011. The second on Dec. 7 of this year, was installed on Sept. 29 of this same year. Both doors were in good standing by June of 2011, when they were removed by the governor.

The third door is on the lower level of the Empire State Building, on the right of the building and the left of the building.

A third door at the same time was located at the other end of the building. The third door now stands on a pedestal at the top of the Building
