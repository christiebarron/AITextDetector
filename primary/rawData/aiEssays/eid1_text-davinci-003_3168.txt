To the Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on how computers have changed the lives of people around the world. 

There is no doubt that computers have revolutionized our lives and the way we interact with the world. They have made the world much more convenient, enabled us to work smarter, and enabled us to access more information than ever before. The development of computer technology has made it possible for people to communicate faster and more efficiently. It has also enabled us to streamline our daily activities and stay better organized. 

However, I believe that the effects of computers can be both positive and negative. While it is undeniable that computers have opened up a range of new opportunities, it is also true that computers can be a source of distraction and stress for many people. They can be addictive, introducing an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle that can lead to obesity, depression, and anxiety. 

I call on the readers to be mindful of the risk of excessive computer use. We must use computers sensibly and ensure that our lives are not completely taken over to the detriment of our physical and mental health. Technology should be a complement to our lives rather than a substitute for it.
