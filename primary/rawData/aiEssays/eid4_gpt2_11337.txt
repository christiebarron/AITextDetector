The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there are more interesting questions than answers. I got to know Hibiscus in my high school years before my PhD in biometrics. He introduced me to biomolecular imaging: the science of creating and manipulating biological fluids. As a senior, I used a special microscope and then got my PhD in biochemistry just to make more of a physical, rather than a clinical, study. His research helped me understand how to do molecular epidemiology. He also gave me a brief introduction to genetics. He is a biologist, a professor at the University of Colorado in Denver, and is the main contributor to this article. It was in that journal that I worked with Dr. Hibiscus to develop a new technique called gene therapy. (This may not be his idea, but it was good enough to get my PhD in biochemistry through to the end of my PhD.) I read his blog a few days after finishing my PhD. I got to know him a little better. He told me that he was happy with the results we were getting during the winter semester. And my best friend, Laura, also had a very good spring. So I made some friends. And I will say it again: Laura is my favorite biologist with me and is also my favorite academic biologist. Now I will say it again: I have only ever talked to her about the biome, but she did some interesting things fingertip bi
