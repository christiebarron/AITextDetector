Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a unique and reflective mood. Through his strikingly visual and honest prose, Rodriguez captures the essence of home, but also reflects on the inherent complexity of the concept. His memoir is both lighthearted and melancholic as he dives deep into his past to explore how he formed his own understanding of home.

The most prominent aspect of the mood invokes a sense of nostalgia. Rodriguez's vignettes and memories draw the reader in, allowing them to share in his sentiment of loss and past joy. Through his vivid descriptions of childhood homes, stories of parenthood and reflections on the past, Rodriguez builds a gentle yet poignant atmosphere of nostalgia. This creates a sense of yearning for the past and a contemplative atmosphere, inviting the reader to consider the value of home and its changing meaning.

The memoir further contributes to the reflective mood by injecting his own personal musings. Everywhere, Rodriguez invites the reader to witness his inner struggles—for identity, connection, and even himself—as he talks about his own journey and the meaning of home. He reveals the nuances of his upbringing and his experiences, all of which capture the complexity of home. From this, he reveals a unifying theme: home is much more complicated than a physical place—it is a sentiment, too. 

All of these elements together create a memoir with an exquisitely classic and resonating mood. Rodriguez
