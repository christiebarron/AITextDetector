One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I used to do "I'm sorry...".

In fact, I'm starting to think back on these experiences now. I wanted to be funny, but this feeling of humor was so different from the feeling of regret, or even rage at being "obnoxious."

Being so grateful for the attention I get at the moment, I want to be like God for this to be a successful year for me, so I don't get angry when I see people's smiles coming from me and I feel grateful. When I'm not thinking and doing my thing I'm just smiling, and so my smile does not seem even flustered.

As my happiness increases, I stop trying to be angry and start to realize it is actually a joy instead of a fear.

It's just another reason why I was able to do so much great work. I've done what I love to do, whether I have it in my own body, or by getting a little more sleep each night.

This is my new gift, and it's the way I felt when I was little.

Because when I was only a little kid growing up, being thankful for things that you could have asked for was something I never did.

This gift has changed completely for me.
