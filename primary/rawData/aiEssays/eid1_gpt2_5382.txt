Computers have many effects on people. First is stress. Secondly, it's our ability to do things ourselves that causes the people responsible for producing those effects.

People who are obese have a higher BMI that's higher than people who aren't obese.

People who are obese gain weight faster.

Even people who are fat and fit can be obese.

It would be interesting to consider when these characteristics come together to form the shape of our lives. Let's say that there's a 50-50 relationship between the way we're physically, emotionally and intellectually healthy that's correlated to how well we've performed in our lives.

We should take advantage of this correlation to predict how healthy we'd be if we were to use it as our tool for shaping our lives.

It would be a shame to see some people with high, high-calibre and underweight lifestyles, which are all of the things we should do, suddenly lose weight and become obese.

But people with high and low obesity rates would probably have a lower survival rate because they're less likely to have metabolic disease, diabetes or heart disease, and they might also have low immune function.
