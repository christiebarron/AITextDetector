Laughter was always a treasured piece of my relationship with my grandmother. Even in the hardest times, she was always able to find something funny. She had an infectious laugh that could fill a room, and it would serve as a reminder that joy can never be taken away from us.

One of my most treasured memories of us was during one of my trips to visit her in the summer. We were taking a walk in the park and I was trying to tell her one of my favorite jokes. I ended the punchline and looked to her for a response but to my surprise, there was nothing. I had gotten my words mixed up and so the joke was completely nonsensical.

Instead of mocking me for my mistake, my grandmother put her arm around me and started laughing joyously. I joined in shortly after, and soon our laughter filled the park. A few other people nearby smiled at us, and it felt like the whole world was connecting with us for a moment.

That memory will always stay with me. And every time I hear a funny joke, I remember my grandmother and her contagious laugh. Even without her here to laugh with me now, her spirit of joy is something Iâ€™ll always carry with me.
