Computers have many effects on people. They are very important for health, a source of inspiration for any and every good life. What I found in my computer lab was that there were so many different applications for these tools that the most important ones would often get ignored.

So I decided to try and keep my work at least a tad more accessible. I am now using these tools to help people make decisions about how to best care for themselves.

How do you ensure the machines we use and care for are running as smoothly or as regularly as possible for your purposes?


In my work, I also use tools to make a better choice about how different types of computers work. For example, sometimes I want a computer with an off-the-shelf, high-speed optical drive, and sometimes I want a computer which can run at least 3 machines per cycle, but I can run a computer with an on-the-fly switch for running a single computer with all of the software needed. With most software, that means a hard drive, a hard DVD burner, and other programs or software.

In my practice, sometimes I need to run computers from my office desk. I need to know what files the software downloads and what I have to do if I really need to, how long I have to wait to download them, when I can access them after the computer has run its initial download, and so on.

So my favorite software is Libre
