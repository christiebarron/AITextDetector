I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, newspapers and other publications is an important part of modern society," said Althusser.

"But if the state, which owns and controls everything, is trying to censor a wide range of opinions and ideas as they relate to a topic where there are not common threads, then I think it's a very serious issue."

Kirkwood said he would not have taken part in the protest if he didn't think it would cause further divisions within the community.

"My view is the debate is on a much more fundamental level. I think it's an extremely serious issue," she said. "There is really no question that we live in an important democracy where different views and voices are heard. The government may not be perfect but the people's view of the problem is completely based on a vision."

Kirkwood said the government's support and consultation with local libraries was critical of the protests.

"[We] should be prepared to take their view and we do need to consider the future, and what impact this political action could have on it," she said.
