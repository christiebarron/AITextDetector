One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we had a couple of kids. I was 16 years old in 1993, I was in my 15th birthday. And the second time I was 16, I said "I'm thinking about going to bed." And I'm thinking, "Why do I do that now?" I mean, it's like, I didn't just want to go to a wedding. It was a dream I had, so I'm not going to have it a day later. I'm trying to become an actor, I'm trying to be an artist, I'm trying to be a businessman. I'm trying to learn as many different things as I can about life, and I'm not the only one doing it. But it's also very personal.

What's the biggest misconception about acting?

Well, we're very aware of that. No matter how many times you are called a "acting nerd," every acting act is real. When you make a movie, you are not making a movie every day. There has to be something or people that you are not.

I think a lot of people just don't realize. I think that is always the biggest misconception because there are so many different people. You know who did something? The director, the director's friend, the actor, is one of the few that doesn't have any experience so it just becomes a different person because they never have even thought of it.
