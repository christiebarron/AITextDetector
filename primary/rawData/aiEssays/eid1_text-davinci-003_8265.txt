The construction of the Empire State Building was a tremendous feat of engineering and design, and the inclusion of a feature that allowed dirigibles to dock was a revolutionary advancement for the time. However, this new technology was not without its share of obstacles. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of difficulties in order to allow the safe docking of dirigibles.

Safety and navigation was a major concern when constructing the dock. The Empire State Building was situated in the middle of a crowded city, requiring a complex navigational system for dirigibles to safely locate the building. The sheer size of the airships also posed a challenge, as the docking mast had to be much taller than the building itself. In addition, the mast had to be incredibly sturdy in order to prevent the airship from bouncing around or tipping over. The builders also had to take into account the winds in the area as they could potentially send dirigibles off course and into nearby buildings.

Another issue was the tethering system used to secure the airship while docked. Finding a safe, strong, and reliable tethering system was a time-consuming endeavor, as the system had to be able to bear the weight of the airship as well as secure it in place while docked. Furthermore, the dirigible had to be able to safely detach from the docking mast in case of an emergency. Engineers had to ensure that the dirigibles could easily be disconnected while remaining securely attached
