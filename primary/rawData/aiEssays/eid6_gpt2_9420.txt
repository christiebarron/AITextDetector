The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Some builders were reluctant to put a dirigible inside until recently after they were required to use it on other projects inside of the skyscraper.

The Federal Building Labor Relations Board has now ruled that these types of building types and dirigs are "reasonable" for docking.

For example, the builder of the Empire State Building was required for years to use full cockpit technology to dock as a dirigible.

And the Empire State Building is now the first one in the world to permit a dirigible inside of a building for up to 2 miles in height.
