I remember one time my family had gone out to eat at our favorite Italian restaurant. We’d finished our meal and were laughing and joking as we were about to leave when the waiter walked up to the table and handed us a fortune cookie. 

We cracked it open, and it was the oldest joke in the book. The “Why did the chicken cross the road?” riddle. We all looked at each other and couldn’t help but burst into laughter. We started quoting every cheesy line we knew and rolling around in our chairs, laughing harder and harder. The entire restaurant stopped to stare at us. We kept going, until we were all in tears.

Finally, when we managed to compose ourselves, the waiter gave us a warm smile and said, “That’s why I love my job. It’s moments like this that make it all worthwhile.” Everyone at the table smiled and agreed. It was a moment that none of us would ever forget.
