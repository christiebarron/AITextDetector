The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The buildings were built according to the strict construction protocols that govern the construction and use of dirigibles and other objects. For instance, the first owners had to pay a $5 minimum. They also had to purchase a built-in tripod. As a result, this was the primary occupation in which they would meet in order for their business to remain effective. By the mid-1940s, these requirements had become a growing problem, with the introduction of the first portable film camera that took as much as 40 frames. The first version of the film camera was developed by a group of engineers at the German Technical Institute, including Max Schumacher, an economist, and Hans Ludwig von Mises, an economist, both of whom had played an important role in developing the most economical method of working with film in the industrial age. The first of these engineers, Hans Ludwig von Mises (1881-1936), was a scientist by birth. With the advent of the production of the first film camera, the use of dirigibles (photographs of living things) in movies and in scientific works was becoming increasingly popular. Eventually, this practice had a large negative impact on the quality of the photographs. By the mid 1980s, a second version of the film camera was announced in the hands of a Japanese company called Kudan Kodak. Although the latter company was not yet successful in commercial
