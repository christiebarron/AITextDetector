One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I discovered who was actually funny.

When I became old enough and started to talk about my life, I was completely alone.

I have been lucky enough to hang out with some of Europe's best comedians, people such as Rohan and Peter Tosh, while I was in Dublin getting my BFA in Psychology.

Today, when I visit a new Dublin and learn a new story, I feel a lot more comfortable and confident.
