I remember one time when I was out shopping with my mother. She wanted to buy a lot of items but the lines at the register were very long. My mom was getting very agitated and kept complaining about how long the wait was taking. 

I, however, remained patient even though we had been waiting in line for almost an hour. I know that my mom was getting frustrated and I tried to be understanding and help to distract her. I started to talk about something else and tried to calm her down. I also made a few jokes to help try to take her mind off the long wait. 

Eventually, it was our turn to check out and the wait was over. Seeing me remain so patient even in such a stressful situation made my mother very proud. She was so grateful to me for not adding to the frustration and remaining composed even with the long wait.
