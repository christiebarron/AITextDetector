Today, computers are an integral part of our lives, and the influence of modern technology on our daily lives cannot be underestimated. More and more people are relying on computers to fulfill their basic needs, such as performing simple tasks, completing complex calculations, and accessing information quickly. 

The real impact of computers is obvious when considering the effect they have on people. For instance, computers have made our work much easier and faster. Plus, they help us with making and analyzing data more accurately. In addition, computers enable us to easily search and access information, which can add value to our lives. 

Furthermore, computers have expanded our modes of communication. People can easily communicate with one another even though they are oceans and continents apart. Plus, with the use of various applications, people can express their thoughts and feelings without being physically present.

Overall, computers have become a necessary tool in certain aspects of life, and can alleviate many of the tasks that are both tedious and time consuming. Although there are some negative effects of computers, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.
