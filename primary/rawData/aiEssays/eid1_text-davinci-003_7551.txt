The protagonist in Winter Hibiscus, Pi, dreams of attending a private school. At the end of the story, Pi has not yet achieved this goal because she must take a qualifying test to be admitted. The test is available only once a year, and her family cannot afford to pay for her to take it multiple times. Therefore, Pi must wait until the next springtime when the snow melts and the geese return before she can take the test again. By ending the story this way, the author emphasizes that even though Pi is faced with many obstacles, she remains hopeful and determined to pursue her dream.
