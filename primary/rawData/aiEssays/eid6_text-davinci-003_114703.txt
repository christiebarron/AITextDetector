The Empire State Building serves as an iconic landmark in New York City, still visible for miles in every direction. It stands as a testament to the technological advancements of the early 20th century and the hard work of the builders and engineers who constructed it. Despite its success today, the Empire State Building faced one major obstacle when it was built--allowing dirigibles to dock.

Safety concerns were cited by most involved in the project, particularly those working under the direction of architect William F. Lamb. The building's site was far too exposed to strong city winds, and the structure itself was simply not designed to dock with any kind of floating vessel. These concerns were echoed in a report issued by Floyd Stremmel, then-Director of the newly-formed Air Commerce Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and it seemed like Lamb's plans for constructing mooring masts at the very top of the building had been put on hold.

Fortunately, the reports coming back from the site were more positive than expected. After some reworking, the building's design had been modified such that the mooring masts could be safely integrated into the design. This would require the installation of steel cables, steel stairways, and even expansion beams running up the entire height of the structure. Additional supports were also added in order to create a solid base which could stand up to the pressure from the strong winds.

Though it took some extra effort,
