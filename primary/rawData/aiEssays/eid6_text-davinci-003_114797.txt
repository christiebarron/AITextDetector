The construction of the Empire State Building posed a significant challenge to architects and engineers alike when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. In the early 1930s, the roof of the building had to be flat and open, with no obstructions, to provide a viable anchoring point for the large airships. This was an incredibly difficult task, as support beams and other structures typical of a flat roof had to be completely eschewed.

The main obstacle throughout the process was safety. There was considerable fear among New Yorkers of the potential danger that wind gusts would cause for the massive dirigibles. Pylon structures had to be engineered and placed along the perimeter of the building’s roof in order to mitigate the wind shear. Furthermore, the pylons had to be anchored, walled and reinforced in order to ensure that the airships remained securely in place while docked.

Aside from wind safety, there were many other issues that had to be addressed. For instance, the operation and anchoring of the dirigibles had to be thoroughly tested. Specialized mooring mast towers were designed to provide the airships with a secure anchor. Following the mast’s installation, it had to be tested to ensure that the entire system could withstand the tremendous winds of the area. Furthermore, adequate lighting systems had to be engineered and installed around the edge of the roof to ensure that dirigibles could find the building while flying at night.
