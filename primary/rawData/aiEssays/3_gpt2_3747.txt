Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It means that theCLEAR-RISE setting makes your roadways more attractive for cyclists, and it affects your overall behaviour in many ways. It also improves the chances of a successful cycling journey and reduces car theft.

"The setting also helps ensure the cyclist has some time of leisure which may be crucial for an early morning commute or to relax at night before cycling," Mr Ritchie said.

The setting works by making your roads and their environment safer for cyclists, reducing the number of carriages that ride up to the street using pavement markings, and improving the cyclist's safety.

Cycling safety is also improved by ensuring that the road is completely cleared of car tyres without using a single colour or marking.

The setting is also designed to reduce the risk that the road will become too busy for cyclists.

The setting also makes them feel "more confident when they cycle, and more confident to run and walk in public", said the Cycling Safety Alliance. It will improve "every road safety measure and design we develop across New Zealand".
