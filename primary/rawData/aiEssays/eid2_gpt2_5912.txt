I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should not affect the ability of people who share the content to keep their views and opinions in accordance with the right not to be silenced," she said. "An important tool in addressing the need for free expression in our government is to support people who contribute to the common good."

The speech is a tribute to the young woman who has served as an activist for online and broadcast media over 17 years. Her activism for an online news organization was in many ways the first to begin, following the release of a series of articles, a book and a documentary by writer A.J. Gray. Many readers took to Twitter to express their support and encourage others who want to take more on the cause. For Gray, the speech had a lot to offer, too. "I've heard other people say how amazing it was to hear it on such an important subject or a day and it's truly special to tell that story to my granddaughter," Gray said on the White House forum Tuesday night. "They're giving me tremendous joy even though all my other thoughts and ideas are lost because all there is to read were lost, and I am heartbroken that the government is blocking that."
