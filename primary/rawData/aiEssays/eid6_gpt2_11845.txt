The PLA's military capabilities do not extend, for example, far east from its core military, and foreign military influence is not confined to China. As a result, Beijing is working to minimize that vulnerability. For example, the PLA has worked to increase the flow of foreign fighters to its border, build an air station and other military facilities, and in a few years have moved military equipment from the Central and South China Seas south and east to China-held territory.
