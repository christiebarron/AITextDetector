The builders of the Empire State Building faced several engineering and structural obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The most significant challenges were in creating a construction that could safely support the mooring mast and the mooring cables attached to it, designing a stable structure at the top of the building that could withstand the high winds and turbulence present in the upper atmosphere, and ensuring the relief of airship passengers when at their destination point. 

The designs of the mast and mooring cables presented the greatest challenge. The main mast was constructed of hollow steel to be as lightweight as possible due to the high winds present at the uppermost level of the building. The diameter of the tubing was 4 Â½ inches and the top was covered in a nonflammable material to protect it from lightning strikes. The mooring cables were then attached to the mast and secured firmly to the ground. These cables were made of cross-linked rubberized strands of steel and could support up to 500,000 pounds of force.

The building features at the top of the Empire State Building also had to be designed to support the mooring mast and the cables attached to it. The uppermost portion included a platform that was approximately 500 square feet and constructed of lightweight aluminum - reinforced concrete to support the immense weight of the airships on their descent. A rounded roof surrounded the platform to provide a safe area in which passengers and crew could disembark
