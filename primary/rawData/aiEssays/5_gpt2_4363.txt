The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' in that we had a lot of good news and that we weren't too late. One thing did stand out about our trip is that by our first time down the island, our trip was complete," Chiang said. "It was like there were many great sights here."

That's exactly what is happening now, said Chiang. "In the week leading up to our arrival, we had several great guests come up to us and say goodbye. In the morning, we took out some cards and got a picture at Dora Dora. And in the evening, we took a picture from Dora Dora with some local merchants in Beijing. "The last thing that the locals did was eat at McDonald's because they couldn't buy anything."

Chiang has just released "From Home" and has a planned tour for April 2014.
