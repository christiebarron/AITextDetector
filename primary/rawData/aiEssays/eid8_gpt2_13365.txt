One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw some girls on a bus at a mall trying to get off. As I looked around, I saw my boyfriend in the middle of a traffic jam or I could see his sister who was laughing all the time and had to look out the door. To the surprise of the other girls who had just got off and started laughing at him, I realized we were laughing at each others. We had a special relationship and had both enjoyed making out. And it was pretty great. He was so funny and friendly.

What I was most impressed with was how much of it came from a simple act of love but how much came from the many different ways girls were sharing their stories, their social skills and their talents. One girl told me, as a teen, she had a crush on some of her teachers and she wanted to teach her how to "kiss" her sister and, at the time, she was just as excited to have this crush as she was with her dad.

I know I was a little hesitant to let my self-esteem get in the way of some of these stories, but I also was pretty excited to discover how others had tried to help. With my friends of many different ages, and with the Internet, there is no shortage of good stories to come out of people's stories that I think can help people see their own inner beauty, have some interesting points of view and share what they learned.
