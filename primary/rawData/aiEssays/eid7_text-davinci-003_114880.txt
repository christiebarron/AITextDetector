When I was just starting my freshman year of high school, I was so excited to see my classes and make new friends. Unfortunately, the first few weeks did not go as smoothly as I’d hoped. I couldn’t seem to make the right connections with the other kids in my grade, and I had a hard time understanding the material in a few of my classes. I was really starting to get frustrated.

I was tempted to give up and just accept that I wasn’t going to fit in or do well in school. But I decided to be patient and give it more time. I eventually found friends who I clicked with and started to gain a better understanding of my classes.

Being patient paid off and I was able to have a successful freshman year. It showed me the importance of staying positive and patient in challenging situations, and I still remind myself of that today.
