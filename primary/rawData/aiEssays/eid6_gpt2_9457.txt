The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to make it a more mobile building than a regular building because of the cost and complexity. The Empire State building has five floors of walkable terrace, and there is no need to walk across the walkable wall of space to dock.

The second obstacle was the massive number of people in the building. It took a lot of people to get there, even though many would have rented a room for at least five.

They did this for the third, with the Empire State building moving on from the Empire State Building.

After many months of getting what they needed, the Star Trek: Generations starfleet joined the Empire State building, but they had to relocate to another building. The Star Trek: Generations players, along with those who had done some work within Star Trek: Beyond, were there to help them, and the ships also moved on.

On August 16th 2015, the two companies announced that Star Trek: Beyond was going to be renamed to Star Trek Online. It is the first time that the Star Trek universe is being made playable on the PC.
