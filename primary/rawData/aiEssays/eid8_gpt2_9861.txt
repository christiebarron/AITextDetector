One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the middle of a trip to visit one of my cousins who I had been in love with. I asked her, "So, what do you think this feels like!" Upon hearing her answer I thought, "I've never thought of such a thing as laughter." Another time had an unpleasant experience when I stopped on my own alder as it seems to be too much like our lives are in a limbo. I would like to share this story and I hope readers who are inspired along these lines feel inspired too.

I know there are a lot of those old school kids out there that will try to scare you into forgetting the truth. There were no kids that felt the same when I was in the middle of a trip because of the story I had Lydia. So, I am trying to convey the good news that my cousin has been making me laugh. What other experiences of humor have you had along the way that you were scared off by?

I think of the days when humor and love were one and the same. My cousin was a genius who loved giving people laughs. He was also a genius who went for a walk and felt it was cool to have a fun ride.

I would like to add to what I have mentioned for the record but if you are a veteran of the Internet then you need to remember that there are some humor people want to do for you. Some may make fun of you
