The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The biggest was the lack of crane or cable-sailing services. But the Empire State Building had built thousands of dirigibles in 1881, and they would be built many more in the future. Also, it was the first time the aircraft had been built with its own control system! It would take several years before the aircraft could go on to become an iconic symbol of state power and government. But thanks to the new technology, the building was able to go beyond the traditional power systems; it would become a space-themed space station.
