The building of the Empire State Building presented an unavoidable obstacle to the docking of dirigibles; the safety of passengers and bystanders had to be taken into account. The obstacle was tackled in 1930, when the New York City Board of Estimate authorized construction of a mooring mast on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. This allowed large airships to dock at the skyscraper. Despite the success of the venture, constructing and running a mooring mast was a difficult endeavor.

Due to the weight of the airship's mooring cables, architects and engineers found it necessary to build a mast taller than the Empire State Building itself. This required connecting the mast to the building, and demands were made for a force proof link. To make sure the mast was stable, it was anchored to the outside of the building at two points to the north and south sides. Engineers used a transfer of load to the buildingâ€™s steel frame, as the mooring lines were frequently shifted when loading and unloading passengers.

Safety was a major concern for engineers and architects. A 45-foot wire cage was constructed around the base of the mast to ensure passengers were not in danger of being thrown off the observation deck. This presented further problems as it hindered access to the mooring mast. As a result, engineers were forced to build a walkway that allowed passengers to board the gondola without leaving the observation deck.
