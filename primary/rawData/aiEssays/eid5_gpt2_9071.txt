The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Dr. Michael S. DeCrow is not good and the book also feels like a collection of books of great interest. In the end:

"In many ways, 'From Home is,' in its own way, an excellent book of scholarship … It is perhaps the last such book of all times, with its remarkable writing style. The work itself is very interesting and I particularly liked how it evoked a little of the sense of hope that I felt about the first two novels. But it lacks the energy, which is a problem with 'From Home, in its original form.' As we know, I had more or less reached an end — maybe I had reached the middle of, perhaps, the next one; but I still felt that the rest of the book was worth reading, as far as I could see and see what is on a shelf somewhere. (Dr. DeCrow, in a commentary on his translation, says that 'From Home is not for new readers; it is quite different from 'From Where Thou Wilt' and 'The Storyteller,' published here the previous month.) …"

"Dr. DeCrow's "From Home" is another excellent book to read as a way to raise money for AIDS research or perhaps to encourage more research at the AIDS clinic in Houston where "from home" has been running in the past six years.
