The issue of censorship in libraries is a complex one that deserves tremendous scrutiny. Libraries are typically viewed as a haven for discovering free expression, and those who seek to police what the public can access are engaging in an unethical form of control. While some material may be offensive or inappropriate for some people to view, ultimately it is the responsibility of the individual to assess the material before consuming it.

Research has shown that the policing of any kind of material can have a detrimental effect on freedom of speech and general enjoyment of the library by its patrons. The removal of certain materials can easily be seen as censorship, no matter how subtle or broad the attempts may be. It inflicts on the public’s right to freedom of information and inhibits open access to the library’s contents. Censorship also sends a message to those who seek to explore these topics that their ideas are not allowed to be expressed, and this can be particularly damaging in the pursuit of knowledge.

Additionally, censorship does not necessarily improve the safety of the public. It can instead be argued that removing certain materials from libraries can result in a lack of education, as some of the most important words and ideas explored in these forums can be blocked from public outlets. This limits the access to topics that could be beneficial to the library’s patrons, such as learning about other cultures, LGBT rights, or mental and physical health.
