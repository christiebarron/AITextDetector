An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with some of my younger colleagues on what was being called 'The New World'. These were people with disabilities. I would say some of these people were on the verge of dying. They had been with us for many years and there were still things they wanted done and they wanted something done. We used to talk about this but we ended up giving it up because we would rather die than live. It was a tough time for them.

When they got that chance to take it back, I said I would give you one last chance. I wouldn't just give up. I would give up. If I gave up, I would get out. If I didn't give up, I would continue the work which would bring us out of what they had been through in those years.

There was a sense of hope that would be there for everybody. It didn't work out for everybody. But by that time, the rest of us were in a state of despair and we looked for something to look forward to. You would see these things in one's memory. There is just a lot to appreciate advises of the people living with diabetes. The idea that Plaisins were somehow somehow able to prevent them from dying, then the idea that they could be a part of a movement to help them. That was a major part of those years â€” and I think it's something that we could all grow up to take back.
