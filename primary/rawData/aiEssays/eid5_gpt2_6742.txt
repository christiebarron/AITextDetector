But on the other hand, "from Home" is not merely a novel. It includes, at times, just about every kind of literary work Ms. Rowling has written in the past decade: a biography, a memoir or poetry. From this book the book is full of the stories, details and feelings that she had to tell, and a personal development to explain them all. And the author's work has led her to be a well-regarded writer of a range of novels of varying degrees of success.

"From Home has a lot about the relationships in the house that I wouldn't normally make into novels, particularly if they were not quite so much about the world," she told A.V. Club in an interview. "I've always had a deep, passionate connection with this world for years. For me, it's an incredible gift to write about this one."
