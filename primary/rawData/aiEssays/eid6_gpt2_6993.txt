The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These included an inadequate railing, an overbearing bridge, and a lack of safety barriers to prevent a fall onto an exposed object.

The Federal Building (R) in New York City faced some of the same difficulties as its competitors. Buildings like the R were constructed from steel in the shape of rods that could be dragged or dropped in water or cement â€” but the cost of these cables for installation was enormous, so the builders turned to a combination of labor and technology: A crane operated on a motor at least 14 m above ground level. The hydraulic pressure of the motor operated a pressure cooker at about 1,000 psi, and the pressure of the steam evaporated after about 10 minutes under constant load. The crane was also about twice as heavy in weight as a locomotive, while its two engines could be operated only with one of the four wheels. The speed limit of most commercial steam engines was about 2,700 pounds per minute, so they only had to be carried a short distance to provide room for the crane.

The only significant innovation in the process was the erection of a crane, which cost about $45 million and installed in 1957. The crane now weighs more than 3,000 tons, including fuel and plumbing, and uses less fuel than other commercial vessels. The crane will be installed next to a railway track in the middle of Rockefeller Center and will be fully supported by cable (
