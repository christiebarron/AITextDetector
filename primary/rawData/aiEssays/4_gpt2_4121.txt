The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it opens with the story of a man's love for a mysterious ghost in a village. This story continues through the entire book, but is less explicit than I have initially expected.

In a sense it's a new chapter in the story, with the introduction of a world where all the members are human, although they're all men (there is a major difference between the sexes in the series). Most of the book is less about the humans, which is one reason why a lot of the characters I'd like to see have to be named the 'good' humans. Instead I want to see them as human beings instead: these characters' motivations were almost entirely their own; the only thing that changed over the course of the book was how they were introduced and then how they became a character in Winter Hibiscus.

In Winter Hibiscus you read a lot about how this world was developed, so that you can make connections, both to what each of these characters were doing in this world, and how the various characters in Winter Hibiscus followed what one might call a'real lives' scenario in their own way. The goal here is really to make connections based on who you interact with and the place for you there to go. So that if you're doing research in this fictional village and are able to see the 'good' humans as the people that lived under you, you're not just seeing them
