Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” is a deeply personal narrative. The memoir takes the reader on an intimate journey of life, love, loss, and ultimately, acceptance and hope.

The mood of the memoir is reflective but ultimately uplifting. Rodriguez chronicles his childhood in New Jersey, from his childhood memories of parades and festivals, to a growing understanding of his heritage and ancestry.

This process is one of healing and growth, as Rodriguez talks openly about his parents’ turbulent marriage and his father’s alcohol abuse, allowing the reader to grapple with the past along with him.

At the same time, Rodriguez speaks optimistically about the future and his hard-fought independence. He chronicles the successes of college and his initial break in the fashion industry, where he went on to become wildly successful.

The memoir’s reflective, yet ultimately uplifting, mood is created through a unique combination of pain and joy. This allows the reader to take away an inspiring hopefulness that is ultimately achievable and accessible. In many ways, it is this combination of challenging the past and embracing the future that makes this memoir so special and resonant for its readers.
