The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 provided the impetus for the development of a landmark engineering achievement: the first-ever docking of dirigibles on a high-rise building. Although the building was designed to permit airships to dock, the builders of the tower faced a plethora of challenging obstacles. 

The greatest challenge faced by the builders was the safety of the building and the airships themselves. To successfully construct the tower so it could support the airships, the builders had to reduce the windloads on the tower, fortify it against the vibration produced when the airships’ engines were running, and design an efficient mooring system that would keep both the tower and the airships safe. To combat the wind loads, the engineers designed an aerodynamic “fin”—a vertical projection extending out from the tower—which was then braced with aircraft cables and used to bear the weight of the dirigibles. To protect the building from the vibrations produced by the airships, the receivers of the docking system were carefully insulated and separated from the structural steel of the building. 

The dirigible docking system also had to be designed to withstand a variety of temperatures and weather conditions. To ensure the system could safely dock airships in the face of snow, ice, and storms, the engineers installed a “form-follows-function”, ball-and-socket mast.
