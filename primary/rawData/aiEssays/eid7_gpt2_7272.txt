An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my wife, who was in the hospital for the flu. My husband was the chief of the hospital and was a caring person. She was really upset and was very emotional. She said that she would not give up without our blessing. I thought that my husband could not do so. I said no one will be able to help her but maybe I can. So I told her no. Then she gave up and was sick for a while.

You are talking on the telephone about her death and some of the other issues that go along with it, especially now that it's been 11 years. Some of this is a family dynamic on one side, of not being in the room, and this is dealing with medical issues on the other side.

I'll never forget an email I got from my wife that day. It was about our kids. It came and it came and it came from all of us. She said she needed a physician. She didn't want me doing this. She said my doctor was in an office but I was there with several of my other children. I knew that I had to pay the bills. I wanted to be able to pay them. I asked if I could help but I told her I felt like she's lost her son. I wasn't a caring person. We thought she was dead because they can't see her. A very sad day for my baby.
