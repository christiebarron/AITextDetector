I walked into the room with a heavy heart, still reeling from the life-altering news I had just heard. I was overcome by a wave of sadness and felt like all hope was lost - until I saw my best friend sitting there, waiting with a mischievous smile on her face.

She must have known that I was struggling, but instead of pity, she chose kindness. She started telling me the most ridiculous and outrageous jokes, and before I knew it, I was laughing along with her. As I was peeling with laughter and wiping away tears from my eyes, I felt some of the weight in my heart lifting. 

Her contagious laugher delicately broke down the walls that had been built up around my heart, and it felt like hours had passed while we were in that room, still laughing even after most of my sorrow had melted away. 

It's amazing how some moments of genuine laughter can completely transform our moods, and I am so lucky that my best friend was there when I needed her the most. I will never forget the beautiful moment of bonding and healing through laughter.
