An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I had surgery to remove my gallbladder a few weeks before the first day on the hospital meds. One surgeon told me, 'If you've ever gotten in your gallbladder, you've seen it in your face or you've had a gallbladder infection in your stomach.' That is what it was called. When I was around 23 or 24 years old, even the most serious cases of colon obstruction that I was having had to be treated as if they were cancers. So, even after we were discharged from the ED, I still had it because the gallbladder was still there that there was nothing to fix.

We had people who worked at home. Two of my friends, my oldest brother, moved from London to Washington D.C. to start their own family. I remember living two years, and I didn't know when I would see my dad. We didn't know what to expect like there was a disease in the family and I couldn't deal with it. My stepdad had a lung attack, so he had to get his first CT. I think with two doctors working there at the time, that's how they did it.

What was your role in your own family in terms of having people who were as supportive as you could, just as compassionate, as compassionate, just as kind and generous as you could.
