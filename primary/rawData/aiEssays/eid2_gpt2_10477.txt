I believe that censorship of materials in libraries like this, including those of children, does not encourage more openness and transparency."

However, Ms Kim thinks it is wrong that schools, universities and religious groups were forced to remove books.

"There is no problem in the education system, especially when it comes to children who should be exposed to the kinds of research that have been carried out by children of all backgrounds and education backgrounds.

"What has changed is that we have increased public awareness of scientific data and education. The same goes in the private sector."

Ms Kim believes that books could provide a boost to a struggling school system, as their academic value could be considered lower or better to start with.

"The main point is that books are not just for children in the context of science. They provide a lot of other services."

However, that would include making it more easy to find literature in the classroom. "It's a better way to reach people and the same goes for the news," she points out.

"Children could decide to read something other than what they would normally read.

"Why are modest books such a bad solution? It has to do with academic quality.

"One of the reasons for that is there's a lot of reading that people read at the same time."

This may be why some universities are already offering a free library.
