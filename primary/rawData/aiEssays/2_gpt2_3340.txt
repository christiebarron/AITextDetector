I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be banned."

The law, which is likely to be adopted by the Assembly during this week's session, follows legislation introduced by Labour's former MP Nick Fitton, who said that in order to be legally binding on public figures, the law must guarantee free access, and to provide an accurate picture of what they have read.

"This is not about whether you can read books on the street, even within your own country," said the MP, who has also signed on to the 'No National Scandal' movement, which calls for people to stop having "an opinion or a book by an unnamed writer on a topic of your choice".

He believes that the law is necessary because if books were available online, or if it was used to disseminate information to other non-educational libraries such as museums, there would not be an end to copyright in public libraries in places such as Scotland (where most people don't own a library that isn't public).
