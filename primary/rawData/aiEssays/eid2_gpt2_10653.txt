I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and universities, especially at the State Department, is an evil that has no place in our government.

We stand against censorship of information held securely, publically available in a timely fashion and in an open and neutral manner. I believe that everyone deserves to know what government is doing all along.

We also stand against any attempt by the mainstream media, including our own, to censor information about us and for that we stand strongly behind the Freedom of Information Act and our national security demands.

I believe we cannot have political correctness in America.

I believe we cannot do business in the West without our own government.

I believe we have to stay in touch with the American people and express my opposition to government censorship on social media.

I believe our government should respect our privacy and take full responsibility for the fact that we are being censored.

I believe we can both be true to ourselves and to our people.

I believe that America can grow and prosper.

I believe we have the right to free expression and freedom of speech.

I believe that it's time to put ourselves first.
