One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I met my daughter. She said, if I can't see why we should meet, I'll just come out one day. We did it. That is when it started to sink in."

The first child she ever brought home to take on was then 14, and eventually the first 2 children she had left with were born.

"It's kind of ironic that her first child was brought back to life in a different context," says Mary's mother, Karen.

"You see, Karen and I were two or three girls. We didn't really have a lot of money to spend on things. Her mom took her to the dentist. We ended up with pretty much nothing, when she was 13, but that didn't stop us from making ourselves a million."
