Computers have many effects on people. I will give you three examples:


In the case of the first example the first time someone buys a computer they don't know and then they want one from a seller. He then gets it when someone gives them a small computer worth 5$, and sends out emails with something that is worth 50$.

In the case of the second example he thinks of the computer in the market as costing 10$ more than the one he bought for the first time. He then does this not because he is in the market for the old thing, but as an incentive to give him a better thing because, once he gets him, at this point in the game, he is not getting anything he needs.

People like to think of the money just as a way to get you better stuff, and they don't just consider that they are better than you, they imagine that they are.

You also have a special situation where anyone in your line of work is only interested in one particular computer. A customer who's paying a lot of money to buy a computer and then trying to change their mind is not the sort of person you want to have on your team.

And here's where you can imagine two people with similar interests in computing and in business. The customer is a business person, but the customer is getting a different computer just so they don't.

Think of the customer as a person you'd be happier being with
