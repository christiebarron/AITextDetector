The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, due to the technical complexities of the architecture and infrastructure. Dirigible docking is a complex system that requires immense safety precautions; mooring masts, towers, and cables must all be present for the process to be effective. 

The Empire State Building presented unique challenges to the builders as the building was over 1000 feet tall and had limited space on the narrow Manhattan skyline. To accommodate the docking of dirigibles, the designers and builders had to work with existing infrastructure and create new, innovative solutions in order to construct the necessary mooring mast and cable system.

The first obstacle was the size of the mooring mast. The architects and engineers had to design a mooring mast that was strong and tall enough to support a large dirigible. They had to limit the height of the mooring mast to under 1000 feet, to ensure that it did not obstruct the view of the surrounding buildings. The engineers constructed the mast using heavy-duty steel beams, which provided the necessary strength and support. 

The second obstacle was the rigging of the mooring cables. These cables had to be long enough to accommodate a dirigible, while also being flexible enough to ensure the dirigible was tethered properly. To create a safety system, the architects designed the cables to be wrapped around multiple strong points, which allowed the dirigible to be locked in place while
