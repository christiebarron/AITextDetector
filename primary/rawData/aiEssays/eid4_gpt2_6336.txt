The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of this change of course in the author's interpretation of events leading up to the book. In the book, the story of a boy named Lyceum leaves out a certain element that I think is most important in the book, namely, The child of Annelah (the same name that is given during Lyceum's time as a boy Azerbaijan), and he becomes a bit of a protagonist in this novel. In "The Boy Of Annelah", even though Lyceum was born and only a month after he and his sister are forced by his father to become witches, he never really shows up until he is twelve. I think this is a bit of an odd balance, because it creates an emotional reaction for Lyceum in the face of his father's decision toGeorgia who's a little bit more mysterious, in that this is another boy being told the backstory of an evil witch by his father and it is also a hint hint that The Boy of Annelah will end up in his life in a certain way or something. My theory is: I think if he is told the facts and the backstory of this child as he grew up he may end up having a certain sense of "what's going on", in this case, that he was born in a strange way and what he became involved in was like how he was always being raised inumann's house and when he eventually starts to play with the broom
