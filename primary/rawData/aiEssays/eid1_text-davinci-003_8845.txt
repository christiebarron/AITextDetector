I was on a packed train one morning, going on an adventure with my best friend. I looked around the carriage and saw all the bored and grumpy commuters and I turned to my friend and joked "I think I'm the only one in here who actually wants to go on their journey". He started to laugh and soon everyone else in the carriage was smiling too. We then had a good laugh about how the other passengers had fallen asleep standing up, and how I was the only one of us who had remembered to bring their travelling snacks. 

That's when I realised how contagious laughter can be, and how one little joke can change an atmosphere in an instant. And in that moment, I also realised how powerful our friendship was; even amongst a group of strangers, we were able to share a moment of laughter. What a wonderful feeling!
