An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a woman. When I started looking into women's experiences online, the most upsetting thing I found was to see people commenting on why men felt they were better off as mothers and how my dad did not want to start dating a woman. It was a terrible experience, but in the mean time, I came to realize that there was a whole generation of women in tech out there that could relate to those experiences, even if they had never worked at a start-up before. I remember my father saying, "Look, all those women that have been working at start-ups, if you didn't get hired, you are going to go home and be homeless. They're not going to come back for you forever, but they're going to give you a reason to stay and not work from home and raise your kids as your own."


So, this is why I'm so excited to be a part of #Hired, a group about working towards change that really engages both women's experiences and also girls' experiences, and that means you can learn more about me at work on Instagram or from a Twitter feed myself.
