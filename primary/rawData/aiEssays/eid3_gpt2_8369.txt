Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, it is used and can be set as a tool of choice â€“ especially when it comes to cyclists that have trouble getting along on the pavement in their usual way, as in the example above). Second, the effect is felt in the surrounding hills. It looks and feels like you are walking through a forest of trees, with some of the foliage falling out of the ground, and there is, like, a lot of rain hitting the hills. For example, it's not clear how much of the trees had fallen, and it's not clear whether they were picked off or were hit by the rain. The effect is felt in the surrounding hills, too, as the foliage is always in the way around your bike, and it sometimes makes you feel like one too.

Rough Road Ahead uses a number of tools at your disposal to make its users feel, and to help those in need of a ride feel, the ability to pause, pause, be silent and say 'hello', and to be heard. It also has some unique features, like a set of small red lights that light up, and a set of two red lights that light back-up when bikes are at full speed. These are a bit bizarre, but can be used very well and be used pretty well by riders who are out there with a low mileage and want a high mileage ride. Once all this has been done
