The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's an honest, thoughtful exploration of the relationship between the world of the books and the actual things that went into their first appearance," said Hirsch, who would never mention the title in a future feature. "The book also doesn't try to write a complicated narrative of magic."

While there hasn't been a book out since 2008's How to Magic, the book's popularity has had a significant impact on the Magic world. "We had this massive audience, and then, once people were hooked," Hirsch said, "it was like, 'Wow, that's a great thing!'"

Hirsch and his co-author, Jonathan Farr, have also talked about their fascination with stories about magic over the past few years, as well as making that particular magic in the world of the books much Zack Snyder (Avengers, The Dark Knight Returns), Benicio del Toro (Thor: Ragnarok), and Joss Whedon (Doctor Strange), as well as other writers, fans and creators.

"It's a very funny book," Hirsch continued. "It never really felt like a comic book. It was like, 'Why would I want to be the person who wrote it?' "
