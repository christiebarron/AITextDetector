I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a serious problem, but there are people that are trying to get it stopped by the copyright reform. I'd like to think about those people too. I have heard from a number of people that want to stop the censorship."

The Library of Parliament's president said that, if the proposal was passed, it would "go a very long way in protecting access to the library by people who already have access".

Under the current legislation, copyright holders will be able to get around this by simply putting out reports on their websites and the rest of their library.

However, this change will likely require the full Parliament to vote on it.

In its manifesto to be published on February 24 the letter suggests removing restrictions on publication of works as well as the rights to copies of works and the right to use the Internet for educational purposes.

"We will remove this clause from our digital and information governance policies this year," it reads.

It is unclear if the legislation, which has yet to be approved by the House of Commons, will go ahead.
