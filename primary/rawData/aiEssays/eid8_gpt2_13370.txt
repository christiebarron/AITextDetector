One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I read this poem. I remember thinking: "Huh? You read the poem from high school where I was bullied by my fellow students. What is that about you that I'm so excited to meet all girls?"

"That's okay. I know what a good friend I am."

"There is a good friend in the library and there are things he read you. I saw the things that he said we do at his shop during my first year at school."
