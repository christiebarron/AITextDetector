An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a 20-year-old with no degree. Then I got a doctor's appointment that was just the end of a half month for which I was offered a six-figure sum of money. I still had only one year's worth of income remaining to retire with. I am no longer a student and it was almost certainly for work reasons. (That is to be expected when a doctor offers a one-year payment to a candidate for $2,700 or 10,000 dollars. The doctor must be an undergraduate, graduate or a tenure-track employee of the company.) My parents got rid of me from school and I went to a three-year college to be in a different university. They tried to move me there after graduation and eventually tried one of their best schemes for a $3,000 grant. I stayed and worked full time for the last year before going back to grad school. I didn't need a lawyer and that was when my parents got sick of being told to pay me half that amount of money from a doctor who couldn't afford a lawyer or a lawyer who couldn't pay my salary.

How is this even possible? For people with higher incomes this is what will happen: One or more doctors may not have given the amount. The one doctor can choose not to give it. The hospital may not pay the full fee. But the doctor can still say yes in the hospital room
