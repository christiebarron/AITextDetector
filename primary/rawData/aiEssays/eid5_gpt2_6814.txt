The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a bit different on some levels. While the author is open to what he has seen on his own life and travels around the world as a young man, he knows few people like him. From here he wants not to be famous but to be successful and successful in his own right. At times his only concern is himself, or if he did, he believes that there is only so much that can be learned from another person's life. But when he first met an acquaintance on the street, he could only take it for granted.

In 'From Home is', Aisha's self-reflection does not change at all, although she is still on the streets and on the edge of her own life. Instead, she continues to find an ally, and her life is progressing, but most of the time, that ally is a human being whose character never changes. Aisha isn't a person who gives up the pursuit of fame she once had.

As if to clear up some issues, Aisha meets a woman named Dinesh, a person she thought she only knew once, before becoming very aware of themselves. When she meets her and his friend, Dinesh offers her the world to make a choice to go on a trip to.

This is an adventure in which the two of them continue to meet people for the first time â€“ the two of them don't really have to know each other
