My best friend and I were walking down the street as we talked about our plans for the night, when I suddenly burst out laughing. I'd just realized that this would be the second time in two weeks that we had decided to head to the same diner. 

My friend stopped in his tracks and stared at me, clearly confused about why I was laughing. I managed to explain with a few gasps of breath in between that it was because we'd both had the same thing the last time, and I couldn't imagine why on earth we were going to the same place again.

My friend chuckled and agreed that it was quite funny. We both started laughing then, even though I don't think we were laughing at the same thing. We continued walking, sharing stories and jokes, and soon enough we were both doubled over with laughter, and we barely made it to the diner before settling back down.

That was the start of what has become a much longer and cherished relationship. To this day, I'm certain that laughter was the shortest distance between the two of us.
