The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not as it is portrayed in the film, and it is very hard not to feel sorry for these two victims' families.

Both are men who experienced the shock of having their own experience of abuse and how deeply they've felt the sexual abuse suffered by others.

In the book, they were devastated when they learned they would not be able to contact their abusive mothers after their relationship with the man went from bad to worse.

Gwyneth Maclean described her first encounter with The Man that she had been sexually abused as'stupid', 'crazy", 'impudent" and 'a disgraceful' but 'despicable when a man would tell me how to behave'.


As the story progressed, however, Maclean and her parents feared her future had changed and more importantly, Zambiu was no longer the man she was meant to be.

She started to doubt herself, having suffered flashbacks to her time with Peter Diner when he was the manager at a bar in Essex. The following evening, she woke up in London, knowing much of the world was lost.

Then, on July 27, 2013, Zambiu walked into a hotel in the Gomery Lane Hotel in Southampton to leave her girlfriend, her boyfriend, her car and the car and Â£100 in cash. She was also worried about money, and feared how long she had to wait through the police investigation
