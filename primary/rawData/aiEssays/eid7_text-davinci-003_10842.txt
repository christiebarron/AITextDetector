I remember the time I was trying to teach my younger brother how to play guitar. I had been playing for years and knew the basics. He had some familiarity with it but wasn't very confident in his abilities.

We began the practice session and he struggled to make the notes or chords. Every time he strummed the wrong chord, he'd get frustrated and want to quit. I was patient with him, taking the time to explain things in more detail, and encouraging him to try again.

Eventually his confidence grew and he began making progress. He even began to understand some of the chords he had previously struggled with.

I was glad to be able to share something I was passionate about with my brother. And I was proud of him for being so patient with himself and never giving up.
