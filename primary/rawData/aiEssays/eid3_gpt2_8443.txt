Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The effect on the cyclist has been most pronounced at the Saskatoon and Winnipeg campuses, since the latter has become the new 'North-south' location from the north (see here for examples of this effect).

In Calgary's 'North-south', the effect is the same with the same effect at the other campuses.

Another benefit of using this setting is to create a 'free-flow' of data. Some of the information that the rider needs to know about the environment changes over time and that the average driving experience is similar in locations outside the city.

For example, in 2013, Calgary had a median of one car in its city centre while Toronto had a ratio of one car to one car. To put that in better perspective, Calgary has roughly 6 vehicles per kilometre in its urban neighbourhoods at the time, but is only about 3 vehicles per kilometre in its urban neighbourhoods now.

In the US, where it has an average of 16 vehicles per kilometre, Canadian cars account for about one third of car travel out of the city and only a quarter of cars in Winnipeg.

Similarly, the effect on cycling can be seen in cities in the US where only a fraction of drivers cycle.

'Rough road ahead' means it is the most-used combination of roads available to people. It also means it has the lowest number
