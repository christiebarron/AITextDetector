I remember the first time my husband and I laughed together. We had been married for about a year and were going through all the awkwardness of getting to really know each other. We were walking through a park when a squirrel passed us, scurrying away with a huge stick in its mouth. I let out a laugh at its silly behavior and looked up at my husband to see if he had seen it too. His face was red with laughter, and we just started laughing together, at the silly squirrel and the silliness of the situation. It felt like a breakthrough moment as we both released a bit of the tension between us and we knew that no matter what came our way, we would be able to face it together.  We still laugh about that moment every now and then.
