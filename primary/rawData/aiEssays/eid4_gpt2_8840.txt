The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because a chapter ends in a line: "B. In the next chapter, you will be allowed to ask questions about this topic."

It makes sense. If the book was as a self-contained game system, then there should be more than one chapter with that title in it that doesn't end with 'B.' The only question I ask myself is whether or not I'd make it a sequel to my own book. I think it would make sense; it isn't like there's a sequel going on here, I haven't considered this. But there are more characters in the movie. As I've already stated, I do think I like the more grounded narrative, but there are some scenes that feel a little bit loose, I think it just didn't make sense to me when writing. I would say at the top of the review I was a little bit worried the book wouldn't be in there, especially as the book was written.

But if I're going to make the final game, can we expect to see that as part of any story? I think its going to look like I have my main characters (Nomi and Su) living around a couple of different countries that don't really feel like they feel like they belong in the same world, and I can see they're like different people living around different world. If they come out of the group, it would be going a lot more like Su
