The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to convey hope. The character in the poem is describing an attempt to take a test that they failed, but is determined to try again. The imagery of the hibiscus buds budding in the spring is used as a metaphor for the character's own hope in overcoming their struggles and passing the test. It is also a metaphor for the resilience of nature, exemplified by the return of geese and the melting of snows, suggesting that no matter what challenges lie ahead, the character will be able to find success in the end.
