I believe that censorship of materials in libraries means that our books are censored." While our booklist is a great tool for making the best of our time-tested library research, it is critical for anyone to take note that censorship of our books isn't something we should be allowed to do any more. We can't even use that power to "disrupt" libraries; it's our right as citizens to keep our books free, especially from the censors' control.

In spite of these concerns, libraries in our state are also taking action to protect freedom of expression, the freedom to read, speak, organize, and explore.

We encourage libraries to use libraries to address the issues we're experiencing, and to share them with their patrons who do want more information about their rights under the law. We also encourage them to continue to explore and write about the rights of all of us, as well as those of those who have been denied access to books, materials, or services in their libraries.

For additional information on how libraries can help in this important fight, please contact the organization's Executive Director, Laura M. McDaniel, at lmccayd@libraries.org or (802) 883-3376.
