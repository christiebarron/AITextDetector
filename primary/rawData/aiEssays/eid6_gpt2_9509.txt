The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they needed space to store the laser beams in to be used on the construction. The building was already home to the most advanced form of lasers possible for the Empire's warship, which was already built atop the Empire, along with eight other Star Destroyers, and a number of more advanced designs, ranging from small-fiber armor to a laser-resistant warp drive system that would allow large-scale attacks from any space vessel. The remaining Star Destroyers were housed in larger, smaller tanks, but not as large as the Empire's larger, heavier, larger and even more powerful warships. By the time the ships were finished in the early 1960s, the Empire's battle-scarred fleet had been severely damaged by a series of massive laser attacks, including both single and long-range attacks by the U-20 Star Destroyer.

One of the many complications was its lack of a large-scale propulsion system for long-range attacks. Although a small number of ships could operate with the Imperial-class fighter-jet fighters, such a fighter-jet could travel at far-accelerated speeds of Mach 1.7 at medium range, and could even sink an entire starship. Although the United States was not directly involved, many other countries involved in the war in the Pacific (and even parts of China and Russia during the Cold War) would be willing to contribute, at least
