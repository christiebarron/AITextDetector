I recently had a horrible experience at the DMV. I spent almost four hours in line, waiting for my turn to speak with an employee and register for a new driver's license. People kept cutting in front of me, but I remained patient and understanding. I reminded myself that everyone needed help and waited my turn. When I eventually reached the front desk, the employee was friendly and helpful. I was so relieved. I kept my cool the entire time, and my patience paid off in the end.
