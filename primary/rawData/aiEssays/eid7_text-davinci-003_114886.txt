I was helping my best friend move out of his old apartment. We were both exhausted from the hours of packing, wrapping, and carrying boxes of possessions. As we were just about finished, I heard a loud crash come from his bedroom. When we went to investigate, we discovered the window next to his bed had fallen out and shattered onto the concrete below.

My friend was understandably frustrated but determined to see the job through. Before I could even suggest we relax and take a break, he began raking up all the broken bits of glass and throwing them away. He worked with remarkable patience, carefully wiping away the shards that may have gone unnoticed. Even when he got a few cuts from the glass, he refused help.

At the end of it all, he had a dustpan full of glass and a big hole in his bedroom wall. We both laughed at the crazy ending to his moving day, but what truly brought me to admiration was his patience. My friend stayed hard working and focused through hardship, never losing sight of his ultimate goal. That's the day I learned that being patient really pays off.
