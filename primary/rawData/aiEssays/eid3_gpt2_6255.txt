Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The range of parameters determines how much of the road should be smooth and whether this will be a slow, or turn-off-y. In the following article, I will discuss how the setting makes cycling the 'wrong' way and explain why some of the variables are important.
