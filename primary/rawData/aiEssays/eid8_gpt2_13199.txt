One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my daughter and I were playing at the mall. I saw a man standing to the door, holding a gun. I was stunned. I'm the only one with a family on this town and we're terrified of what might happen next.

"It was weird, and that first time I'd seen a man with a gun in a grocery store, that was amazing."

We had no idea what he was thinking as people started to push a chair away and shove it.

"If you see a guy walking with a gun it's hard for you to understand anything they're doing," Johnson said. "They look nervous at what they're doing. But no one who does anything in front of their face will ever see somebody with a gun."

"Once we found out what he was doing that night we knew when he made the sign it was all right. It was just all right."

We had no idea that a man with a gun would do that. When we found out I was pregnant my son's sister called to tell him how excited he had been to hear my story.
