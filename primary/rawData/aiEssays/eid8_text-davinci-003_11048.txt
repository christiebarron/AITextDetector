I was walking around town with my best friend, and as we were about to part ways, she suddenly stopped short and said, "Hey, remember that time we camped out in the woods and you tried to make a fire?"

I didn't even have a chance to answer before we both burst into laughter. We had been out late one night, under the stars, trying to make a campfire but it just wasn't working at all. We wound up using up all the matches and kindling, without ever getting the fire going. We were both so tired and exasperated, and I remember throwing my hands up in the air in defeat before we just succumbed to our laughter. 

It was a really silly moment, but it was one of the funniest moments I can remember. That shared laughter brought us closer as friends, and was a reminder of how much we could laugh together. Even now, when we run into each other, that memory never fails to bring a smile. Laughter has the power to bridge any gap, no matter how far apart we may be.
