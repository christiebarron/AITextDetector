One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was ten years old (a girl) that my friend, my co-worker and I spoke in English. She said, "You've been very good about coming out in English that I haven't spoken in awhile." This was great (like everyone else was). The first time that I did it was a lot different.

I remember thinking, when we talk about this stuff, what it means to be an outsider, that we're trying to figure out who's going to be in the room. It sounds so natural, and so natural that people just laugh with it. But they are not the type to have fun with it. It's about you.

"If you look back at me, they had no idea.

"When I go out in my backyard after work, I'd always get a little laugh out of it because I see it going on.

"Because you make your own choices."

I guess I got that in kindergarten, that I could ask my parents for advice. I am just like any other kid today: I come at anything from anything. I want to hear every moment as much as I can, and for the most part, I just want to get out and do whatever is right for me.

I try to be very supportive of other kids. When I come out to my friends, I don't try to change what they are thinking of me.
