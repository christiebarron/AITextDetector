The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' appears to be the most upbeat of all his poems, telling of his experience growing up in an abusive family and feeling trapped by his love of music and the fact that he couldn't work to bring his beloved home. He writes of the struggles he experienced during this time, "I kept coming back to hear what would be my future, but I had to take the time to ask myself what it would be like to be here now, living in one of the world's greatest cities" and writes "It felt like being alive in a place where nobody knew what was possible â€“ and so I was so proud of myself" for what it felt like.
