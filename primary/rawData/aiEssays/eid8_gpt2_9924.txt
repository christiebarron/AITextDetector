One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I asked myself, "Why can't I keep going?" I wanted more laughter. Now I can hear it. But I also enjoy the enjoyment.

So I tried something else. I had a friend who has PTSD. She had a friend who was suffering from PTSD. She was suffering from PTSD. The fact of the matter is that PTSD is a neurological disorder in which the nervous system and muscles become inflamed. Sometimes one of the most powerful muscles in the body becomes paralyzed or killed. It usually lasts a very long time. The muscles around the brain often become blocked and don't allow the nervous system to get out of its own way. The nerves become weaker and don't allow the muscles of the CNS to be able to move properly. There's a psychological problem, and people who need to be restrained (that's the main reason why I became a therapist) are usually not able to get in touch with the nervous system. And the best therapist I ever had was Karen, my friend who also had PTSD. In fact, she got me into such a wonderful relationship and gave me the wonderful experience. She told me that I was completely capable, but I'm like, "Who would ever expect to become your therapist?" And I started to learn to use it, to love and to connect with people that I would never have known existed before. I was doing that to a great extent.

So this is what you can
