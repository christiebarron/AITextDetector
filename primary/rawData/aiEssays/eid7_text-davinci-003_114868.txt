I was heading to the bus stop on my way to my college classes when I noticed a woman crossing the road. She took several minutes to cross the intersection, moving painfully slow and shuffling her feet. Iâ€™m typically not a very patient person, but her age was clearly in her favor, so instead of mindlessly spinning my foot and growing angry, I decided to stay still and wait for her to make her way across.

The entire time I watched her slowly shuffle across the street, I felt a dull sense of shame wash over me. Here was this person, doing everything she could to just go about her day and I had these selfish thoughts of not wanting to be held up, even if it was a few seconds. Eventually, she crossed the last lane of traffic and I inwardly thanked her for her patience.

I think everyone could learn an important lesson from what happened; while it might seem like a few seconds are being wasted, we should be patient and look out for others, no matter the situation.
