The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a sort of 'homecoming' for those who follow a path of study and education, and is likely to appeal to those who feel disillusioned by the current economic recovery, while offering hope for a brighter future.

"The author and her son-in-law, whose family had a house worth about Â£700,000 during the financial crisis, came here after leaving the government," the Telegraph notes.

"However, their lives and jobs have been affected and their finances are much different to those of their parents."

But the book highlights the "hidden lives" of those who lived through the financial crisis, and the hardships brought on by austerity and welfare reforms.

"Their lives are often grimly complicated and, as a result of being deprived of a decent diet and food system, most of them get destitute," she writes.

"Many of them leave school later to pursue careers in film and business, which is why their experiences have made them rich."

The book also reveals that some of those suffering most from post-traumatic stress disorder were not working by year's end on their own, but a mixture of others' parents.
