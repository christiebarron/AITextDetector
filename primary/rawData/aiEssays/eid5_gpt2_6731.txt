The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is something of an odd one. In his first book, titled 'The Book of Life pierces with an old adage', he described himself as a "young man who had a chance to give his own personal interpretation, a unique expression of his own life, but in spite of all that he had seen and experienced, had suffered a lot". His words were as prophetic as ever, even a week later they became almost impossible to forgive because 'our hearts are like the tip of a spear'.

We need to look elsewhere as the author does not consider himself a saint or a prophet who made the world a better place.

However, in one particularly prophetic passage in John 5 we see us trying for something in a desperate effort to be, in his words, "good to God and good to us".

"He said, 'If I go from being God to an animal, my head is turned, my heart is shut and my eyes are shut'. That phrase, especially in his foreword, is what makes the world a better place â€“ indeed, the words are perfect for God.

"So when this was thought to be a matter of personal choice he simply said, 'I'm a prophet. I'm a human being who was born in a place and I am a prophet".

The writer's mind is thus in tune with the realities of our time. As we continue to live it
