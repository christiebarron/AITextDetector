I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is critical to public safety. I personally look for the preservation of my life and the preservation of the culture that we all love. Unfortunately, these materials contain so much information that are no longer needed to keep us safe.

My support is so much more than my books and poetry. I can't wait to share in these materials with you. I promise to keep you from making a future use of these materials that you do not enjoy.

Thank you as always for your support. You are my life. You will never be forgotten." -Johan V.

Thanks for all the support, Johan, thank you all.

Thank you at the Open Library Archive,

Thank you, my friends! Your help is a huge help in keeping us safe. Your encouragement and love is the foundation of what we trylying and what I try to share in this blog: I hope this does not diminish one more. Please, continue a relationship I have had with Johan since the beginning and continue to hold up the other three of you for the love of your lives.

I sincerely love this man and would like nothing better than for his story to end with
