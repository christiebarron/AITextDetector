The Empire State Building was initially planned for the purpose of mooring dirigibles; however, a variety of obstacles stood in the way of achieving this unique feat. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article “The Mooring Mast,” the reader is given an overview of the seemingly insurmountable task the builders of the Empire State Building faced in order for its mooring mast to become a reality. 

One of the most notable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was size. The mooring mast they proposed was to be four to five feet in diameter, reaching 80 stories high. Such an ambitious structure posed a significant safety risk due to the high wind speeds to which it would be exposed. Consequently, the manufacturers of the dirigible had to be consulted to make certain that their airships could handle the structural demands of docking and the strong winds of the region. 

The second problem was the mooring mast’s height from the ground. Early studies revealed that because the dirigible was to dock at the top of the mast, it had to be located above the roofline of the building. To do this, mechanical lifts were required to bring mooring cables, airship crews, and passengers to the docking area—an unnecessarily expensive and complex process. 

The third challenge was the materials that had to be used for the mooring mast. These materials were subject to incredible
