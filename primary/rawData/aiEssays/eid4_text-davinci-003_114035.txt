The narrator of “Winter Hibiscus” is a young immigrant living in the Midwest who is trying to make a life for herself while avoiding the discrimination she faces from her peers and neighbors. The story ends with the narrator's realization that she cannot change society overnight and therefore must be patient and resilient if she wants to succeed. The hibiscus is symbolic of her hope and optimism despite the odds against her, and the promise of returning in the spring is symbolic of continuing to strive, no matter how difficult the journey. The narrator's final line, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” illustrates the narrator's commitment to continuing to strive, no matter how difficult the odds may seem.
