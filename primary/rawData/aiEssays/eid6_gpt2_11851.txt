The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For one thing, they didn't realize the possibility of a fully functional vehicle (think an SUV or even a car), and since most American cities generally have a small number of large, well-equipped mass transit systems, many of those systems can't handle much more than a few passengers at a time. In contrast, building a mass-transit system would allow many more passengers to commute from one location to the next, without getting stuck on the street waiting for the next train. And because of all of these advantages of a fully functional commuter experience, the concept was eventually abandoned, along with any major transportation hubs around the country.

That's because the current design for the Empire State Building has one thing in common with the concept of an electric car. In order to drive, all three engines must be connected via electronic communication, allowing for the same motor to travel at the same speed. It's important to note this design incorporates a few things, as wellâ€”like the fact that the passenger car will move like a standard car, without power switching off, making it more stable if not more convenient for transportation, as well as for transporting vehicles, since these elements would have to be linked up together to build a full-sized system.

Though this idea of a fully mobile and fully-electric commuter experience can seem like a bit of a stretch, it actually sounds very reasonable
