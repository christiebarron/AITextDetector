Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people, and to discuss why I think readers should agree with me.

It cannot be denied that computers have an incredible effect on our lives. Whilst many applaud their advent and usefulness, there are plenty of less desirable effects that they possess. Electronics distract us from our education and hobbies, waste our time, and in some cases, foster more serious addictions. They also have adverse effects on our health as hours of sitting in front of a computer screen can cause physical ailments.

I believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that our use of computers is well-managed. We must set boundaries, prioritize the more important tasks in our life, and ultimately cultivate a healthy relationship with technology. That way, we can avoid the pitfalls of technology and take full advantage of the opportunities it has to offer.

These arguments provide enough evidence for to why I feel readers should agree with my opinion. To waste no more time, I implore readers to recognize the methods of careful navigation of this digital landscape. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Signature]
