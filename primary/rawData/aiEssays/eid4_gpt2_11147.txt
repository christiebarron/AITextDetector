The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's also the story of the real Hibiscus â€“ the one who stole the title (he's dead now, not reanimated and not still alive). Hibiscus was born in a cave near the western edge of town, known simply as Mt. Fuji. According to him, the world is overpopulated and his family is gone. At the end of the novel, as the author talks about his experience, the story actually goes "like so many legends:

"He went to the library, read the Book of Snow and Fire and saw a picture of Hibiscus, who was not alive, who went into his room and asked if he and all the others know anything about this place. Hibiscus explained that they believe the picture of Hibiscus is that of Lord Edom. They all knew that he was dead. So I could see his face, his long hair, his eyes, their faces and the faces of their loved ones!"

After reading the last page of the final pages, the next thing I recall is Hibiscus speaking in gibberish from the grave. "Ah, that's the true spirit! The true spirit that was born just there when my parents died and is now lying on a rock-covered platform beside the earth-loving Lord Edom!" In other words, Hibiscus is a true spirit. The other characters are also there.
