The builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles are large, floating aircrafts distinct from airplanes because they are filled with a lifting gas, such as helium, to be buoyant. The building was originally designed to be a dirigible terminal, with the enclosed mooring mast positioned at the very top. However, the builders soon found that a variety of challenges had to be overcome to make the building suitable for docking and landing. 

The height of the building was a primary issue. The Empire State Building was much taller than existing landings places for dirigibles. This was problematic because the aircraft had to be able to glide slowly to the dock. Additionally, the building's design brought with it rigid wind currents and dangerous updrafts, which could be especially hazardous for an aircraft not built for high speeds. To mitigate these risks, the builders incorporated numerous safety measures, including steel “ladders”, that functioned as internal windbreaks, in the mooring mast.

The Empire State Building was also subject to changing weather conditions and highly sporadic wind patterns. This made it difficult for the builders to determine the appropriate speed, and even possible for an unlucky pilot to end up with a wind direction that would “box him in”. Furthermore, since dirigibles can be adversely affected by wind gusts of over 25 miles per hour, the builders were faced with the challenge
