The Empire State Building allowed dirigibles to dock at its mooring mast, an unprecedented feat of engineering which can be attributed in part to the pioneering spirit of the architects and builders. However, getting to that point was no easy task. Numerous obstacles from architectural, economic, and political difficulties had to be hurdled in order to make the mooring mast a reality. 

The cornerstone of the project was architect William F. Lamb’s iconic design, which included a mast extending up past the 102nd floor of the building. The complexity of this structure posed a significant challenge to the builders, as the roof had to be reinforced and particular attention had to be paid to the lines and wind stays which allowed for a safe mooring. Additionally, the importance of the mast meant it had to be built to precise specifications and to exact shapes and tolerances with little room for error. 

The mooring mast also presented unique economic considerations. The materials and engineering needed to complete the project meant a significant cost, and the potential for making a return on the investment was unclear. In addition, the mast itself was liable to damage from dirigibles due to its exposed position and the unknown dangers they posed. In order to gain assurance that the project was financially feasible, the building’s owners negotiated extensively with numerous parties for guaranteed payment if a dirigible was damaged by the mast.
