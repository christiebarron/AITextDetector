Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line because it serves as a metaphor for how the protagonist is feeling. She is feeling daunted and overwhelmed with the knowledge she needs to learn in preparation for the test. At the same time, she recognizes that she will take the test again and this time it will be easier. The imagery in the line ties back to the beauty and resilience of the hibiscus, which parallels the protagonist's own journey to resilience despite feeling overwhelmed. It is a testament to how even difficult times can be overcome.
