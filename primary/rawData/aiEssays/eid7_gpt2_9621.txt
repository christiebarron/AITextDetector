An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I watched a clip of a live video conference in which a person was having an argument with an analyst. She told me to take him to the emergency room because he had "shredded" himself. This was not the norm in my time, but I was told to stand up for ourselves because it was common sense to not have the fear of being attacked. The reason an emergency room was used as a place to fight an attacker wasn't because of the media or because of the safety of me or her family, but because of my own behavior. I think that's why it's important that we act as if our actions make a difference.

When you're dealing with those threats to those people, they may be a challenge for you but they're also a distraction to yourself, my family and the people you care about. That's because I'm still dealing with the fear of being raped and the discomfort, loss, and uncertainty. Eurasia is still a place where I live and there are so many people who don't take it seriously.

You seem to have been a bit outspoken in the past about how you think the "silly news" was hurting people in China. Do you share that sentiment today in a positive way?

When I listen to people's opinions and I can be very clear about that, it's not an endorsement for what they might have been thinking, the comments or anything
