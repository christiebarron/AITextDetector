I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is illegal and would end their ability to collect donations in their wallets," said Hilda Pascale, the director of public prosecutions at the Australian Human Rights Commission.

According to the Australian Human Rights Commission, one of the primary reasons for the death of the Australian Museum of Fine Arts is due to the removal of its archive.

The museum's exhibition collection was restored by the Library of Parliament in 2005 after a series of scandals resulting from a series of scandals over the collection's disappearance following the dissolution.

The collection, which will be displayed on the NSW State Archives in Sydney for the first time in 2016, was in place on January 14, 2015, when the library was destroyed, the Australian Register reported.
