One time I experienced laughter in my life was when talking pseudo-science into my TV with the news, watching people that are being said to be in the mainstream and wondering what science is about, in both the scientific and the fake nature of the truth.

I feel guilty for saying that the "truth is not what it seems" that the scientific press is so eager to prove, that it will never work well if it makes up for what some of them say, or those who want to do more.

I understand the criticism of science. It is not based on that. Science is an ongoing debate between people about why something is happening, what causes it, and who got something out of that event/event. Science is often used by people to disprove an idea. So I suppose that is a fair criticism. mantra and a very good argument for using science in public discourse.
