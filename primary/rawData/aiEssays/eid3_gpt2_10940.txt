Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. This is the second of an analysis of the same in our book: the cyclists with the most 'hurdles', the ones who get more points for taking less time, are significantly more likely to suffer the roughest road ahead if they get a higher number of points. The evidence is consistent with the notion that there is more opportunity for improvement in more rural areas. It also provides a better view of the impact of road closures and better transport. It also gives a hint into why the overall picture of social mobility differs from that for motorists and cyclists. The research suggests that while the 'toughest roads' are associated with higher costs, the worst places to spend time are often more remote areas.

This raises an intriguing possibility. Perhaps people might prefer driving when they are more involved in activities such as running, walking or driving a motorbike. Why is driving a more important decision than in other commuting and leisure activities? Or are cyclists taking more responsibility for the safety and the security of people on the road? Perhaps in a place like Australia and in other regions other Nixonians might want to be the 'unconscious cyclist' on the bike.

We could also consider the impact of many other factors which we cannot do in the US: the more people drive, the greater the cost of driving. The authors point to research on the effect of car use on commuting and the influence of
