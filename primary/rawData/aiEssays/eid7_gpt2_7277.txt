An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my son who was a medical student working in one of the hospitals that provided care for children with dementia or Alzheimer's disease at Sibie. We both worked there for four years, and as our daughter got older, we became very close. We also worked and shared our lives together with our daughter, so I remember the moment one evening I went into the room of our family room and sat down to watch one of her brothers grow up into a more mature individual. She quickly turned three and two, but kept going just to the left so I said to her "my brother is not getting older", which made her smile. By this point, she was just six years old and had moved to the hospital. It was on her arrival in my office that I made clear that we would work together to give them the time they needed to grow up to become fully mature adults. This was in conjunction with my husband's work to reduce the odds of dementia to such an early age that all of his younger children should eventually get old enough to go to college. We'd go out with people we met as a family who could walk to school and eat, and then do all the things that I'd never done, from being in my mom's room to doing hand-washing, with friends to making a birthday cake I made, and to cooking, to cooking a salad, to cooking a turkey, to making a meal for a small child
