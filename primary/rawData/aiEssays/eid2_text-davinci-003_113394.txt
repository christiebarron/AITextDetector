In the present age, censorship is becoming increasingly prevalent in libraries across the country. Libraries are meant to provide a place for citizens to freely access and explore information, yet restrictive policies are making libraries increasingly homogenous. In a time where we should strive to make libraries open and accessible to everyone, it is of utmost importance that censorship not be allowed to infringe upon individuals’ rights to seek knowledge.

Books, CDs, movies, and magazines are all important tools for gathering information, and it should not be up to library administrators to decide what content is “offensive” and should be removed from the shelves. While all libraries should observe responsible guidelines (no pornographic or otherwise excessively violent material), library administrators should not be able to arbitrarily decide which materials are “inappropriate” and should be removed, as this would be a violation of First Amendment rights. 

Censorship in libraries could also have a negative impact on our education system. In order to make informed decisions, individuals need to be able to access both traditionally accepted and controversial sources of information. If these divisive perspectives are discouraged, students may be denied the chance to develop independent, critical thinking skills. So not only is censorship an infringement of the public’s right to information, it can also inhibit students’ growth and miseducate them.

At a time when libraries should be safely fostering intellectual curiosity, censorship is an insidious violation of patrons’ rights to access information.
