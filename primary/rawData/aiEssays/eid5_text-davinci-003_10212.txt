The memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez creates a deeply reflective and emotional mood. The book starts with him reflecting on his life and his Spanish-Cuban heritage. He remembers his childhood, growing up in New Jersey as the son of Cuban refugees, with stories of his grandmother’s cooking and his mother’s strength. He speaks of his family’s pride in their heritage and roots, and how this shaped his journey to become a successful fashion designer.

The memoir is poignant and escapes from basic chronological narrative to move onto philosophical reflections, and these melancholic musings are powerful triggers for the reader’s emotions. The author gives us a unique glance into his creative process and its connection to his Hispanic background. He expresses his pride in wearing his mother's traditional Cuban dress as he walks the runway, and his sadness of having moved away from beloved family members. The stories of his struggles as a young designer in New York City, the loss of a close mentor and friend, and his feelings of joy for the successes he was able to tap into help create a vivid image of the highs and lows of life.

The overall mood in this memoir is deeply personal and atmospheric. Each chapter develops a certain emotion, whether it's happiness, sadness, joy or inspiration. The reader feels fully immersed in the author's story, and can truly sense and understand his passion for his craft and culture. His
