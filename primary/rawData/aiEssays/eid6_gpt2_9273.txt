The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the lack of a way for aircraft to take off and land on port side of the building or onto a carrier. The second obstacle was the lack of a way to dock up to an expressway that connects YouTube to the air traffic control.

"You need space, you need a way to dock," says William White, a former Boeing engineer who helped design the space shuttle. "The world got wind of that until about 1972, when the Shuttle landed and the Air Force finally agreed to make the space station permanent."

For his part, White said the design process was more streamlined, requiring more time for the first to ship in and out of the office, but still allowed for the use of the aircraft, not a port side docking.

"I thought, 'Whoa, let's try on the cargo plane.'"

The Air Force, which has a long record of doing this, says it is willing to ship with the aircraft for free, which is a fairly significant step for it.

After an airport would be "overbuilt, then rebuilt," an expressway would need to connect the United States and Canada, including the South Atlantic City-Lancaster International Airport, the Navy's James F. Kennedy flight from Dallas, or in a few other locations.

The Air Force has never, however, done this.
