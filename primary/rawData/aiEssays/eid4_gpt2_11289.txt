The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it really captures the moment. I'm also not sure what the story is about either, but I think it really shows off how far things go in anime.

In short, Winter Hibiscus is also the best story Ever! Since I came up with It, but I haven't read it yet. I had the chance to read it last year and I can say that I've been very impressed with the overall story of the book compared to the series. It really tells a story that would have been pretty easy to explain in light of everything that's happening around him.

Why so many of the events here start out as simple but that go on to grow into more complex and complex storylines? It might be a bit too much for a beginner, but it seems to work pretty well for those who have read more about the show than it does for others.

Well, if something is really important, it feels really important. That's why you've never heard it explained in a more direct way. So it seems like there'd be a lot less explaining to do as well, to get as deep a meaning out of this. I'm not looking forward to any further explanation, because I've got so much more content to cover as that volume of stories continues.

Are you going to try it more in your next series? If so, what other things you'd like to do?

Yes
