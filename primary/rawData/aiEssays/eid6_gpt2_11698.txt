The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Unlike conventional powerplant vehicles like a plane, where both a and b can travel as long as two, all cars needed a special propulsion system to maintain altitude. "We had to convince them that anything they needed to control was their own," recalls Foltz. "They were convinced that the aircrafts required more energy than would be found in a conventional engine. It looked like an impossibly low price to us to be doing this sort of thing."

So the Germans built four large dirigibles, one that was more like a tank than a jet. In 1937, they installed a special propulsion system to control their jet as well as the air control system. This, however, required some careful machinations, like taking a step forward using two wheels on the tail, and turning on a special laser to send the jets back to the factory where a full-size prop would work.

In the next few years, Foltz experimented with a number of other solutions, and these all involved using one of several different types of engines—from one type that controlled one part of a vehicle to another that controlled different parts of the vehicle. "We decided for a long time to just try to find the right technology that would allow us to turn all those wheels and keep them moving," says Fröhlich. "Eventually, we thought the technology would work. For all practical purposes,
