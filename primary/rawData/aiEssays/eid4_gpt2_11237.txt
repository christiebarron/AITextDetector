The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because each chapter goes back to when he was trying to write the best, shortest, best book of his life. He's a very intelligent editor!

The story of Rainford the Snowman is fantastic.

One of the things I love about The Shining is that it's often too close to the plot, in that they try to tell a story that would make the audience want to come back to the very scene they loved the most. Thesteamers have more plot here than they do in the book. When you look at all the twists, you would say that The Shining must have been too close to what makes Rainford such a great story to write. Or at least give the book enough weight so it can stand still while a much smaller audience watched. Or at the very least, give him a chance to look at his own world that would make him feel like he had taken this far, because there is something you shouldn't be afraid of.

I really love the whole art.

That's how much I love it.

There are no problems with those illustrations that I can't find any other work out there. Those are wonderful work. One day I wanted to do a full chapter of my own, just complete it without Yorker, and there was a huge amount of pressure to do it, but I didn't really think it would be possible since I already read the entire book now.
