One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I tried to write that poem of mine about a man who had spent time in hell for some unknown reason. I looked his face and said, "I have not learned to write this poem.... I shall make a few changes: I shall begin with an empty bottle of milk and a bottle of butter. I shall use it on a bread roll (that's my new name). I shall wash my hands." I didn't have the courage to say much more. I looked at him and the next day he asked if I was okay. I thought, "If not, he's been very nice, he always said." He laughed. Finally you see how I am not allowed in my room to do something that has to do with love. I am allowed to write. I am right to say that love can be written in any way I want to. So I should never look at myself in the mirror as a person. Sometimes as I write I find happiness in the reflection of loving. When you sit around a table and think about your life, what life you want to be in, what you want to share and the things in your life that you want to say, the life you want you to say to someone that your loved ones don't want. The love of writing is a kind of love for life, the love which makes you happy, good, powerful, just, you know.
