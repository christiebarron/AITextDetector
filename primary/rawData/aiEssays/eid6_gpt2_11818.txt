The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first of these was the installation of a bridge between the main building, the Empire State Building, and the bridge on the west side from east to south.

As the Empire State Building was about 7 feet tall and 13 feet across, the Empire State Building was 6 feet tall and 25 feet across, all along the western edge of an enormous steel span. Because the state building spans were 30 feet wide, the building would need to cross the city, but the construction boom of the 1950s allowed taller, walk hoops to pass through the area.

Eventually, the bridge was finished in 1964, allowing dirigibles to dock across the City of New York. The dirigibles were finished in 1966, the original height of which was 35 feet by 20 feet. The bridge also received its very first use in 1975, when the Empire State Building was named after New York City, as part of the Empire State Convention Center's new name.

As the Empire State Building was still the tallest building in New York City at the time, it was the tallest of all, standing at an astounding 488 feet with the Empire State Building and two other towering buildings that span that same span.
