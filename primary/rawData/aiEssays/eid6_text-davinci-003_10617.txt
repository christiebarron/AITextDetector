The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1931, towering 1,454 feet into the sky. It was built with a unique featureâ€”a mooring mast designed especially for dirigibles to dock. For a variety of reasons, however, the Empire State Building has never played host to a dirigible. This essay will examine the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle builders encountered in trying to invite dirigibles to dock was the location of the building. Positioning it in the heart of a busy city center meant that there were concerns about safety, as it would be difficult for dirigibles to maneuverer between the skyscrapers. There were also worries that the turbulence from passing airplanes and other dirigibles might prevent the mooring from working.

The second obstacle of which the builders were aware was the strong gusts of wind that regularly sweep across the top of the building at various speeds. Although a mooring system had been designed specifically for dirigibles, it was unable to withstand the powerful winds. A more comprehensive mooring system was needed, one that could keep a dirigible stable in high winds, but this would have been too expensive to implement.

Lastly, there were technical and logistical issues around the mooring mast itself. The mooring was connected to an elevator, which was designed to allow passengers
