The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead", greatly affect the cyclist in their journey. 

The poem begins with the cyclist coming up to an intersection that has a deserted looking road turning off to the right. Here, the cyclist is antsy and wanting the road to end. The deserted road is described as being "scarred from neglect and disuse", emphasizing the potential danger of taking this side path. The cyclist is aware of the risk they'd take, but continues to look at the road because of the "yearning for a different route". The cyclist is drawn to the road's potential, even though the outcome is uncertain.

As the poem progresses, the cyclist continues down the road that is described as being "narrow, rutted, and overgrown". This creates a sense of physical discomfort for the cyclist as they have to be more focused on the issue of navigation. The narrowness of the road is also a hindrance on the cyclist's speed, so they struggle to keep up a strong pace. Additionally, the cyclist begins to get fatigued from the length of the unpaved road and the sheer difficulty of the route.  This is due to the fact that the terrain is constantly changing and presents new challenges for the cyclist.
