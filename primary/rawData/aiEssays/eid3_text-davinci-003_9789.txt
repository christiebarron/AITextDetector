The features of the setting in 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski have a huge effect on the cyclist in the story. The character is a passionate cyclist who never misses an opportunity to go on a ride, but he soon finds himself in a difficult situation because of the setting.

The setting starts off with the cyclist traveling through a winding mountain pass. The road is switchbacking up the mountain, making for a longer, harder ride with lots of switchbacks and climbs. The cyclist is forced to push himself to the edge of his limits as he navigates his way through tight turns and curves, as well as steep climbs. This is made even more difficult by the fact that there are no breaks in the climb and all of the curves must be taken at full speed. The cyclist knows that any mistake on these roads could be deadly, but it's his only way to the top, so he pushes on.

The setting also involves a seemingly never-ending descent on the other side of the mountain pass. In this stretch, the cyclist is faced with an entirely new and different challenge. Now instead of struggling against a steep grade, he's fighting against gravity and speed. His momentum takes him faster and faster down the mountain, and he's almost completely out of control as he navigates around tight corners and through sharp turns. Again, any tiny mistake could be fatal here, putting the cyclist's skill and courage to the test.
