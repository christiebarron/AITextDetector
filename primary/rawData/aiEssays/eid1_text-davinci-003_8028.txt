The builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant challenge when allowing dirigibles to dock, and available records suggest the task required compromise and innovative technology for success. 

The building's prominent height and leadership in modern skyscraper design represented an unprecedented opportunity for providing air travelers with a direct link to the city of New York. The task, however, was not an easy one. Primarily, it was necessary to determine an appropriate system for safely connecting a large airship to the building, and then successfully use that system for mooring and disembarking. 

According to The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it was proposed to use a mast—essentially a tall steel pole—on the roof of the building for the purpose of airship mooring.  This mast was to be attached to the building by two enormous cables at the west side. At its top there were plans for a permanent mooring post where the airships could attach. However, it was generally agreed the mast was far from ideal, as it put the airships at too great a height above the ground.

The solution to the mooring problem, as Lüsted points out, came from Thomas W. Byers, a partner at the firm of Starin and Baldwin. He proposed that a steel net be hung around the outside of the building. This net would act as a catchment system, and airships could easily drop
