I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is really not helpful because you are free to spread and share copies of your book, provided you pay no fees.

There is currently no way for libraries to ask for permission to print the book.

There are many ways for libraries to request permission to print books in libraries and sometimes they require permission based on individual library requirements.

A number of libraries around the United States say they do not receive a letter from the state library asking for permission to print books. The majority of large libraries across the U.S. are located in a non-voting, non-educational district, so these requests are not granted. If that is why you need to request permission to distribute these books, then you are not giving the state permission.

It's really important to understand that an unelected government will determine how much of a library or library directory in a certain community changes to the general public. If you're interested, you can contact yourellect@columbia.edu or go to the National Library, Endowment for the Arts, or the National Endowment for the Humanities or the New York University Library for information on how to get involved, and to get involved with your community. You can also have a general conversation with them about how to get involved with libraries in your area.
