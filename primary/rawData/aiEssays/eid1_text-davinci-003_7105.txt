In Joe Kurmaski's story Rough Road Ahead, the features of the setting create a unique experience for the cyclist.

The story opens with the cyclist setting off from a suburban area that is described as "homely" and "hilly." This suburban setting serves to bring vivid imagery to the story of a cyclist pushing his limits in an area not easily navigated by bicycle. The hilly terrain and lack of bike trails create an extra obstacle that pushes the cyclist both emotionally and physically.

The terrain also works to set the scene for the climactic moment of the story. With each hill, the cyclist feels as if his environment is growing more unfamiliar. This sensation amplifies as he passes through obscure forest trails, giving Kurmaski the opportunity to create suspense as the cyclist's destination remains unclear. The conflicting feelings of fear and excitement serve to fuel the cyclist's motivation.

The powerful peaks and valleys create a landscape that at once challenges and motivates the cyclist. It acts as a physical representation of the intense emotions coursing through the cyclist's mind. The struggle and conquest of an unpredictable terrain embody the inner journey of the cyclist as he faces his own personal trials.

Kurmaski's use of the features of the setting allows for a unique take on a cyclist's internal struggles. The grandeur of the peaks and the mysteriousness of the forest represent both physical and symbolic obstacles that the cyclist must conquer in order to find his courage. Ultimately
