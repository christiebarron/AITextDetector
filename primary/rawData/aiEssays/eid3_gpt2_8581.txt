Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The fact that your roads will offer plenty of space to use may result in indoors vehicles in a more stressful situation.

You may be able to use your roadieties and safety schemes in the same manner as normal cyclists

At the same time, you may need to be proactive and maintain the level of safety or efficiency.

A number of features in this setting may affect the amount of space left on your road.
