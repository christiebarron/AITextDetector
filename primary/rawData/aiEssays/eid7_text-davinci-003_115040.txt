As I looked around the classroom, many of my peer's faces were scrunched up in confusion. Our teacher had just asked us to complete an impossible task. I, however, felt strangely calm. I decided that instead of panicking, I would take deep breaths and start piecing together the puzzle. 

Throughout the whole process, I was able to stay focused and patient. Even though I was overwhelmed with all the work I had to do, I didn't let frustration own me. Taking steady strides, I slowly and attentionally tackled the task before me. 

In the end, I was able to complete the challenge--much to the surprise of my classmates. I know that it was my patience and determination that allowed me to succeed where everyone else had failed.

Patience certainly paid off in that moment, and it's a lesson I have carried with me ever since.
