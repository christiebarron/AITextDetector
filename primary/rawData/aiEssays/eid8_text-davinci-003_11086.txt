I was out of town visiting my best friend, Julie, when we decided to go on a picnic. We arrived at the park with blanket, food, and a digital camera. Everything was going great until we spotted a squirrel in a nearby tree.

We started taking pictures of it, but then it started to climb down the trunk of the tree straight towards us. We were both laughing so hard, and we were completely surprised when the squirrel landed on Julie’s lap! We were even more surprised when it started to eat the food we’d brought with us.

We both continued laughing until the little guy had had enough and ran away. We were both in tears by the time he made his escape.

That picnic was the highlight of our weekend away, and I'm so glad we got to share such a silly and surprising experience, filled with lots of laughter.
