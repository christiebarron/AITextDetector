I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In many ways, computers have been a positive force in our lives. They help us to quickly access large amounts of information, stay connected with friends and family, create personal projects, and work from the comfort of our own homes.

However, too much computer use can have a negative effect on people and their relationships with others. Too much time spent on the computer not only reduces the amount of time we have available to socialize, but it can also lead to physical health problems. Many people develop back and neck pain, headaches, and eyestrain from sitting in one position for long periods of time, and this can lead to further health issues.

In addition, our mental relationship to computers can become an extension of our emotional lives, allowing us to hide behind a screen and interact electronically instead of in person. We may end up feeling isolated, disconnected from our family and our friends, and emotionally blocked.

It is important to take into account the effects that computers have on our lives, and to use them responsibly. We must remember to take breaks, get a good amount of physical activity, and establish boundaries around our time spent using the computer. We should also strive to socialize and interact with people in person, and take advantage of the opportunities to be connected with others in real life.

I believe that by taking these precautions, we can be sure
