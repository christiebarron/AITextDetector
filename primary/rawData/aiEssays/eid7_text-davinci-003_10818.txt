 

I was serving as a preceptor for a student nurse and I had it all planned out. We were about to tackle the most difficult part of the day, giving a patient her medication. She was not in a great mood and combative with her care. As we started to approach her room, I noticed she was very quiet and she had her curtains drawn so I decided it was best to wait before we entered. 

I waited patiently for a few minutes and then decided I should check on her. When I opened the curtain I saw that she had fallen asleep. She woke up, and I noticed that she seemed significantly calmer. I introduced myself and told her what we were there to do and she cooperated. 

She was very grateful when we were done and thanked us both for being so patient with her. This experience taught me that a little patience can go a long way in healthcare.
