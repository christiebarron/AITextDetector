Dear Editor,

As technology continues to take up more and more of our lives, it is essential to take the time to assess the implications of new forms of technology. One such technology is computers, which have become increasingly prevalent over the last several decades.

From my perspective, computers can certainly have a positive effect on people. Access to computers is a tremendous educational asset. By providing access to vast stores of knowledge, computers give people the ability to grow and learn in ways that were previously unimaginable. Additionally, computers can help foster connections between people by providing an easy way to stay in touch over long distances.

At the same time, computers can have some adverse affects, especially when used excessively. Overuse of computers may lead to blurred vision, poor posture, and hearing loss. Additionally, for many people, computers may become a source of distraction, making them less productive in more traditional activities such as studying and reading.

In conclusion, while computers can be a wonderful asset, it is important to use them in moderation and be aware of their potential downsides. With that in mind, I encourage all readers to use computers to improve the quality of their lives, but not at the expense of their overall health and productivity.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
