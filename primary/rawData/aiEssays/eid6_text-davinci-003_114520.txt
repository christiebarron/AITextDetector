The building of the Empire State Building involved overcoming a number of obstacles, not the least of which was providing safe docking to dirigibles. Early on, it was seen as an opportunity to innovate and transform the skyline of Manhattan. This meant finding a way to allow these massive airships to use the building as an access point. However, there were several challenges that needed to be considered.

The first obstacle was the very limited space available on the roof of the Empire State Building. Not only did it need to be wide enough to accommodate an airship, but also high enough. In order to make it work, engineers needed to come up with a way to fit a complex mooring mast, known as a 'skypole', which stood at over forty feet tall. The skypole served as a platform from which airships could dock, but its height and size presented a significant engineering challenge.

The second obstacle was the wind strength and directional changes that come with such a tall building. Wind turbulence made choosing the right type of fastening link, as well as the materials used in constructing the skypole, absolutely essential. Engineers needed to use durable material that could withstand the force of strong winds and unpredictable gusts.

Finally, the third obstacle was convincing authorities that the mooring mast would be safe for passengers and crew, especially in bad weather. This meant that engineers had to prove that the skypole could withstand strong winds and turbulent air conditions that could
