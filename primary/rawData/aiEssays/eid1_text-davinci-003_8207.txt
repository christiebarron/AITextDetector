The Empire State Building was one of the most iconic examples of early 20th century architecture, and its builders faced a unique challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock: How to equip a skyscraper with the necessary infrastructure to anchor the huge airships. The builders had to devise a highly specialized solution to the problem, with very few existing examples to inspire them. This essay will discuss the obstacles they faced in allowing dirigibles to dock and the eventual solution they chose.

One of the biggest obstacles facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the issue of infrastructure. Most traditional airships used a mooring mast and system of rigging to secure the craft against the ground. However, no skyscraper existed that could accommodate such large and heavy objects. The builders had to create both the infrastructure and the necessary support equipment to secure the armature in order to make dirigible mooring feasible.

The builders also had to contend with the issue of safety. Airships of the period were notoriously volatile, and the addition of a mooring mast atop a skyscraper raised the risk of disaster should the ship brush against the building in a storm and damage either the structure or the airship. Thus, the builders had to devise a reliable mooring system that would keep the airships safely away from the building, yet still allow efficient transit of people and cargo.

To solve these problems, the builders of the Empire State Building opted for a cutting-edge,
