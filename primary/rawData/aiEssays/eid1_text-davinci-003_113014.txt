Dear Editor,

As computers become increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, it is important to consider their effects on people. While there are many benefits offered by computers, their widespread use can have adverse effects as well.

In our ever-connected world, it is difficult to escape the eyes of computers. Computers can improve our access to large amounts of data, but they can also lead to an overload of information. As the amount of information we are exposed to increases, we can become overwhelmed, unable to focus on any one thing for long periods of time. In addition, too much time spent in front of a computer can lead to physical health problems such as eye strain and back pain.

Moreover, the impersonal nature of computers can lead to disconnecting from the emotional needs of the people around us. By replacing face-to-face social interaction with text and emailing, we become less capable of responding to others with empathy.

It is true that computers offer many advantages; however, it is important to also be mindful of the impacts they can have on our minds and bodies. We must remember to take breaks in order to give our brains a rest and must strive to stay connected to the people around us to avoid losing touch with our own humanity.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
