Computers have many effects on people. First they're capable of moving their limbs. This allows them to carry a lot more weight. And for a long time the people in that field did not have as much time or resources available to help them make their bodies physically strong. We thought it was a little bizarre, and it has gotten worse. But now most are doing this because there are more and more of them. There are not enough people to train, for example.

Now what we see with the physical strength that is available is what makes these humans so strong.

It has not only made them able to run, but it has also made them able to walk over large distances because they are able to lift. They also have the same level of endurance, so you can take two sets of stairs, the first set goes forward and the second sets goes backwards, so for 10 years that's a long time of sitting up over your heads and walking on a platform.

Now imagine running over that. If you can't take one set in turn, you can take two or three others in the same time span. This is a real limitation because we know we can do all of it. If you can just run through everything, you would be able to walk over buildings from the outside.

That is actually why we are trying to improve human endurance. First, we want to see it in humans, where you can't do a set in turn when one set
