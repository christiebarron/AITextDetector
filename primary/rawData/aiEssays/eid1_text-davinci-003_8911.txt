Dear Editor:

In recent years, technology has revolutionized the way that people live, work, and play. Computers, in particular, have had a tremendous impact on our lives. While many people recognize the tremendous positives that computers bring, some are more hesitant to embrace them, citing potential negative consequences.

I believe that, on balance, computers are beneficial to people. Computers have opened the door to previously unimaginable levels of productivity. We can now accomplish tasks more quickly, easily, and accurately than ever before. Our communications abilities have been expanded, allowing us to connect with people around the globe. Online learning and entertainment have enhanced our lives, giving us access to valuable educational and recreational resources.

Of course, it is understandable that people are concerned about the potential dangers of computer use. For example, there is the danger of addiction and lack of physical activity. However, with responsible use, these risks can be minimized. Computers should be used as tools to improve our lives, not as replacements for them.

All in all, I think that the effects of computers on people are positive ones. They have allowed us to accomplish more than ever before, while providing us with new avenues of education and entertainment. With responsible use, computers can be a great asset to us.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
