Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In my perspective, computers have had a major impact on our lives and have become an essential tool in learning, communicating, and entertainment. 

Recently, computers have made many aspects of our lives more convenient. For instance, online educational tools have enabled students to learn from anywhere in the world. This has made learning more accessible than ever before, increasing opportunities for those who may not have the resources or access to traditional education. Additionally, computers have enabled us to communicate with loved ones from great distances. Through technology, we have the ability to stay connected with each other, no matter the location. 

Furthermore, the world of entertainment has benefited greatly from computers. Streaming services can provide endless hours of entertainment, and online gaming world offers a diverse range of experiences. Computers have also automated mundane tasks, such as grocery shopping and banking, making these daily tasks easier than ever before.

However, it is important to recognize that too much can be a bad thing. While computers can help us to better keep in touch with family and keep us connected, spending too much time on computers can negatively affect our wellbeing. Therefore, it is essential to find a balance when engaging with technology.

In conclusion, computers have changed our lives in many positive ways, but it is important to remember the potential negative effects. I hope this letter urges readers to recognize the positive effects that
