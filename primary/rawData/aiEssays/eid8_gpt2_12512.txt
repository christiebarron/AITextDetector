One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched a show called "American Horror Story: Freak Show." One day I saw this video of a man wearing a beard, as though his beard, as he told the camera, was nothing, when he said he did not know anyone who identifies as Christian â€” a joke to which I had no response, because I was at home. One day I watched a story about a Mormon who was murdered. He said there are five Christians and a little girl called Davenport. I just stood there, and then when I got to the end, he said, and then we went through this same sequence, and the end was different. I know this from reading or seeing movies. But I had never seen anything that said 'I believe in the resurrection of the dead. No, I believe in the resurrection of a woman', and I thought, this is really not a matter of belief in any other religion, because if you don't believe in resurrection, God does not allow you to believe that."
