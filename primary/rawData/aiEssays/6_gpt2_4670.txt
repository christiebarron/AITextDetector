The builders also feared that with the two main strikes, the workers may become even more reluctant to move during the strike.

Even in the days immediately following the World War II strike, workers held more protests, and in the years following World War II, they made a point of being willing to go through the motions themselves in their union or protest on behalf of a better working environment. This also meant that when workers were in danger, they could make concessions to union officials. In 1936, the building was evacuated by two workers who had already moved several times and were unable to do so. In September 1940 they took their complaints to the National Press Service, which had ordered the removal of the crane from public view. They said the workers would ask for money to get out of court.

These were also both major labor-owned construction firms, having had large shares in the building trades from the 1950s to the early 1960s. In the 1980s the American Building Industry Association and American Federation of Teachers organized
