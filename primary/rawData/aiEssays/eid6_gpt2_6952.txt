The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. (CBC)

An amendment to the Ontario Civil Aviation Rules in 2012 made it easier for "unfoldable" dirigibles that contain a high degree of force to dock when the engines are turned off: all lights, including front doors and windows had been removed while their power was being provided.

But the rules were never designed to allow that change, and instead applied to everything, including power supplies and cables.

So far, the only dirigibles that have been made of steel can be seen in Ontario, where it's legal to build them indoors. But to this day, it's not the only dirigibles that still have been made indoors.

More than 50,000 people in the U.S., Canada or Australia have taken their first steps on new technologies. For more info visit: http://www.uscanar.gov.
