The Empire State Building was designed to be able to accommodate the docking of dirigibles, a type of airship that became popular during the early 20th century. Although this seemed like a simple step, it presented a number of obstacles for the builders of this landmark building, as described in the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The most immediate challenge was the fact that dirigibles, also known as airships or zeppelins, were much larger than traditional aircraft. Because of this, the building had to be re-designed to allow for a special mooring mast to be constructed. This mast was 350 feet high and weighed over 150 tonnes, making it one of the tallest and heaviest structures in the city at the time. This imposing structure meant that it needed to accommodate the entire weight of the dirigible, allowing them to come in to land safely.

The mooring mast also had to be designed to ensure that the dock arm itself could support the weight of the airship. The arm was made out of metal tubes filled with concrete, and was braced from the 86th floor of the building. As the dirigible came in to land, it needed to be securely attached to the dock arm using cables or steel hawsers.

The builders of the Empire State Building also faced a major challenge when it came to the wind. In order for the dirigibles to be able to
