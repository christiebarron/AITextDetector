I can still remember the moment like it was yesterday. It was our second date and my partner and I had decided to go for a walk along the beach. As we were talking, I was looking out at the beautiful sunset over the horizon.

I then noticed something quite peculiar, and couldn't help but share it with my partner. I pointed out a man, standing still with his arms outstretched and a seagull perched atop his head! We both started to laugh uncontrollably. It seemed so absurd that we couldn't help it.

The man eventually saw us laughing at him and joined in, this only made us laugh more. After a few minutes the man gave us a small wave and continued on his way. We stood there laughing for a good few minutes afterwards.

The experience was so strange yet so wonderful, it was like a magical moment that we both shared. To this day our relationship is more special to us, because of that instant of laughter we shared together.
