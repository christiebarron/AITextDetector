I remember a time in my life when I was really tested in terms of my patience. I adopted a puppy from an animal shelter and little did I know about the huge undertaking it would be. My pup had some very rough times in her early life, and it showed in her behavior. She was anxious and highly reactive to most new things. She barked constantly, refused to be walked on a leash, and was very unruly.

It took hours and hours of patience and understanding for her to slowly start to come around. Each day, I made sure to provide her with the proper guidance, calming reassurance, and lots of love. We worked on her leash walking together and just generally tried to show her the world was going to be okay.

Over time, she started to become more obedient and even began to enjoy her daily walks. She started to trust me more and more and gave me affection, something I truly never expected.

Without my patience, I know for a fact that my pupâ€™s life would have taken a very different direction. That experience definitely showed me the true value of being patient and I will never forget it.
