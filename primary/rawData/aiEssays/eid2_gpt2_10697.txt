I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can be effective. Indeed, I believe that it can be a major change in the legal structure of libraries in the United States.

I hope that other Americans will stop to consider the great power that technology offers us. There is an old saying, "We ought to let our children play by the rules." This year, we found that it would be wise to let children play by the rules because our nation has more access than ever to our kids. We are no longer a democracy â€“ our children are not safe anymore.

My organization, Our Revolution, is dedicated to ending the domination and use of technology by adults and to making our country a leader in the use of our digital resources.
