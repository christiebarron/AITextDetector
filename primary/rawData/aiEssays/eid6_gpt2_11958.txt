The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some were still using the built-in wall-mounted displays in the windows, which were installed at the top of the building.

"We don't have any control over dirigibles, though," said Robert Pang, a construction specialist at the National Association of Realtors. "There's no incentive for people to make the leap from a plane to a movie theater as long as it's done using the same display or its own type of display."

"If it had made a profit, it would have been a lot safer for people to jump from a big airplane to a movie theater."

On the other hand, some builders who had flown dirigibles that didn't fit inside their existing display cases complained there was little incentive to change their existing displays. The problem was that they had to re-install existing displays, which made them difficult to use again.

"We are using the same display that there are a lot of other movie shows and people could have easily jumped from one theater to another," Eric Crain said, referring to the famous movie "The Prestige at the End" and its director of photography, who starred in the film.

However, there are some good reasons to make changes to the displays. In other words, making those displays less difficult for people and more likely to get into the theater.
