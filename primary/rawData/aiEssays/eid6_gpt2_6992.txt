The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On July 27, the federal government voted to permit dirigibles off-limits to any aircraft. On December 8, a panel of US states deemed the ban unconstitutional by a vote of 54-46. On January 9, the Ninth and Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling. On February 3, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 1st Circuit's decision was the correct one. On February 15, a group of judges from California and Maryland joined the panel at the end of a series of hearings that included testimony from people familiar with the case. An official from California Attorney General Kamala Harris referred to the judge as the "Judge of the Year."

"Bryan Southerly" is an author, filmmaker, cartoonist, and journalist who published "The Hollywood Reporter," and "The Hollywood Reporter" was shot for his books and articles on film history, Hollywood, and filmmaking.
