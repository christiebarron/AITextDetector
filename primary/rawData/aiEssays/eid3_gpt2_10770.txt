As explained in this section, a cycling education program will help support cyclists by providing them with an understanding of cycling and learning about where to get to on and off roads. They can then continue riding the roads with the knowledge that they will be approaching cyclists who are not prepared to go anywhere near them either in a safe manner, or by using other modes of transport such as bicycles.
