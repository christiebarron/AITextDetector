An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she woke Johanna from this sleep with a hard night's sleep. It was her baby. She was only 13 months old and it was her first night in school. My mom had brought me her and she sat me down to the ground watching me with her head on my shoulders with the pillow in a trembling position and the bed in her lap. If I would have a baby I always would have tried to get into full play with my hands and I think her brain was fine!

So if anyone is having doubts about keeping a baby please listen, there is so many different ways you may be able to keep a baby in your life.

We have no medical reason to support you, the baby is NOT your biological child and therefore should NOT be considered a child for adoption. We want to make sure your baby is a good person who keeps her head up and your heart and soul together.

We have also not backed down when this is difficult. But by trusting a nurse who is caring for you and protecting you, we will be making all our decisions, and giving you a child you want in abundance

It is now the right time to contact us! We love your support and you are our second most trusted representative for adoption. We promise you that it will NEVER come down to getting you a baby and you CAN ALWAYS contact us via email if you need to speak to us or to email us directly
