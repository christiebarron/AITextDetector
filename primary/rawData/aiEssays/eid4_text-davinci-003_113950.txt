Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this quote to symbolize hope and the potential value hidden beneath the hard work and dedication of studying: just as the hibiscus blooms in the spring after enduring the winter frost, so too will the student pass their test if they stay diligent in their studying. The quote can also be interpreted as a reminder of resilience and to always keep fighting for our dreams no matter how difficult the path ahead may be.
