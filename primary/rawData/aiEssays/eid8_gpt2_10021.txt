One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I received a call from their manager asking for a new job. He wanted me to work hard to pay off my debts. He had a hard time finding a decent job, even after working a six-month break.

But, I said that you have to work hard because you are always losing.

I don't think anyone was going to get that job.

I thought this would mean they were going to go into debt anyway. If you can't find a business that is competitive and allows you to earn money, then no one will ever hire you. What is better paid though is working with your own business, rather than taking on huge amounts of additional risk.

I felt so much pride as a worker and loved working with him.

I started getting phone calls from family who wanted me to move as an independent business partner, and soon felt like a freewagon.

Over time the relationships with a very good manager at my firm changed.

The manager told me that he needed more money to be focused on my clients, and I was given the job.

I had worked for a decade on a small company, but I was still a big man and got asked into a contract to make money on a firm which was no good, not just because I did not want to be able to make the money I wanted from the family I shared with.
