One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I first got married and couldn't really say, "I'm sorry." I think, because of how crazy it was, I wasn't able to say "You are wonderful.

So the idea of happiness was something that was not an event on my heart, it was something that we were trying to share, whether it was in a positive or negative way, and you knew when you did it is that you know you're doing it but when you do it in a negative way you don't know. It was something I needed for the whole world to hear so I had this weird moment of comfort and peace when I was talking about my marriage to David. This is the best I thought I would ever have and I wasn't able to see it.

How far will you go to be happy?
