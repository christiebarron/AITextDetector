The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' began to change when a friend decided to publish it, which made it even more shocking for him. He also realised that the book had attracted him in an entirely normal way, especially given that his friends knew about his experiences with transphobia.

'This is where I started to realise that I was in a very strange situation, and that I need to be able to live with something new,' he says. 'I'm not aware of the other LGBT people in the world. I'm really afraid to live openly with my fear of being labelled in such an environment.'

He was taken out of his home and spent the next month in Thailand. He is now recovering in Singapore, where he hopes to continue writing.

For those who are reading here he describes how the experience made him 'the most aware person I ever went to with my friends'. 'I was aware that these people were homophobic or transphobic, but also knew that I was transgender.

'I was also aware of being surrounded by people, particularly young people, who made me feel more comfortable because of my gender identity. I felt more alive and had many people know that I had this disability.'

For these people he describes the 'normalisation' of his past by people who feel that the way he was'mocked with being ridiculed or ridiculed is normal' and wants everyone to be aware of how uncomfortable it can be.
