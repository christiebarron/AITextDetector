The Empire State Building is an iconic New York City landmark, and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. Over the course of its construction, this majestic building had to overcome many obstacles, not least of which was the challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles were an innovative form of air transportation which had risen to prominence in the 1920s after the tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937. Docking dirigibles presented engineers and builders of the Empire State Building with an entirely new set of problems that needed to be solved. 

In order for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, a mooring mast had to be designed and installed. This involved erecting a two hundred-foot steel mast to the top of the skyscraper, and creating strong wind cables that could securely grip the dirigible when landed. The design of the structure was based on the idea of a ship mooring mast, hence the name.

The process of building a mooring mast was not without its challenges. First of all, the steel mast had to be able to withstand powerful winds, since the Empire State Building is located in an area that is prone to strong gusts. Secondly, a strong and secure grip had to be achieved so that the dirigibles could safely and securely dock. To ensure this was accomplished, the mast was designed to be multi-stranded and encased in steel, so that it would be able to withstand
