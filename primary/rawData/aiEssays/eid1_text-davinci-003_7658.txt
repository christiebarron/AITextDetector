This line serves as an optimistic ending to the story and conveys the idea that, although difficult challenges may lie ahead, better times will eventually follow. The imagery of "snows melting" and "geese returning" reinforces this idea with its imagery of rebirth and renewal, symbolizing a hope for a better future. By connecting the protagonist's goal of passing the test with the symbol of the hibiscus, the line helps to demonstrate how her goals and her dreams are all part of one larger cycle of the natural world, a cycle that continues no matter the obstacles faced.
