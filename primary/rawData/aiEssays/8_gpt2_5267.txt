One time I experienced laughter in my life was when someone said, "I'm so sorry I haven't seen you in a while, and you'll be OK." "Good bye," I said. "Good day, and good luck." As everyone else is starting to have more fun of saying the same. And, if you're just taking what you're meant to say for granted, there's not a lot of hope for your friends in life if you don't follow all of the rules and not follow the message.

You'd think that maybe I'd just come along and say that I was good enough to be with my brother because I grew my heart from the first part of my life and the second part was me. I thought I could just enjoy living forever. Now, I'm not saying I ever will or that my life would be a total waste of my time. But it's always nice to find someone I can share my time with and have a little time to myself while I'm away or in a busy place.

What I do realize is that when you're not at your best, it's the hardest thing to tell someone you love. Sometimes you can't see yourself without someone you love, and when you're in a situation where the people around you, especially people like you, don't give you that look as easily as they will, you just want to feel safe.

I hope this helps people. In the meantime if you're in
