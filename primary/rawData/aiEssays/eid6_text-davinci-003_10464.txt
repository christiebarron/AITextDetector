The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City presented a unique engineering challenge in the late 1920s - allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The attempt to make the world’s first skyport is a fascinating story of overcoming numerous obstacles.

The primary obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was meeting the preconditions for docking a dirigible. To ensure navigational safety, the airship had to hover above a mooring mast which was strong enough to withstand the powerful engines of the airships of the time. The mast had to be extend high enough to act as a guide and it had to be able to hold a hangman chain which could be linked to the airship’s mooring lines. To minimize sway the mast had to be steel and the tallest mast ever constructed to that date.

The engineering feat was quite impressive. The steel mast stood at an impressive height of 204 feet and weighed in at a staggering 45 tons. Its impressive width was set at 12 feet and it was topped with a metal housing which provided protection from the wind. The uppermost section of the mast contained a hinged platform on which the airship hangman chain could attach.

Once the mooring mast was constructed, the challenge was to docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building and ensuring that its passengers and crew could disembark safely. To do this, the platform attached to the m
