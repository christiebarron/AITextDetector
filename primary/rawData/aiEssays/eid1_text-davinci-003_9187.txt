Dear Editor,

As computers become increasingly relied upon in our society, I feel that the effects they have on people should be discussed. In my opinion, computers are both a blessing and a curse. 

On one hand, computers are a great tool for promoting communication, organization, and creativity. With the help of computers, we can stay connected to family, friends, and colleagues, no matter where we are in the world. People are now able to create and publish content online quickly and conveniently, and access an infinite amount of information.

However, computers can also be harmful if used in excess. Too much time glued to a screen can lead to physical and mental health problems such as backache, eyestrain, headaches, and a heightened level of anxiety. The pressure to stay connected in this digital age can make it difficult for people to unplug and take a break from technology.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that, while computers have improved many aspects of the human experience, there needs to be a balance between technology and rest. With the proper use and moderation, we can enjoy the many benefits computers offer while keeping our physical and mental health in check.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
