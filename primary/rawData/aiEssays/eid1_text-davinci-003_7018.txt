The issue of censorship in libraries has come to the forefront of debate in recent years. In particular, there is a debate over whether some materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. Proponents of censorship in libraries argue that materials which contain offensive language, or which could be considered immoral, should not be readily available to the libraryâ€™s patrons. On the other hand, those against censorship in libraries worry that hard-line approaches will lead to the suppression of important ideas and could equate to the censorship of alternative and dissenting opinions.

It is important to acknowledge that any move to remove materials from a library should be done with delicacy and thoughtfulness. As an institution that is focused on providing materials to the public, libraries should not take steps without due consideration and the inclusion of alternative viewpoints. This is especially true when it comes to the removal of materials that could be deemed offensive. 

Rather than banning materials that could be considered immoral or offensive, libraries should instead focus on educating their patrons. Making sure that people understand the possible implications of certain materials can help to create a more open, informed, and responsible public. Libraries should also provide materials that discuss or critique any material being removed, or that present contrary points of view. This way, patrons can form their own opinions and make informed decisions about the materials they may wish to view.

No one should be exposed to offensive language
