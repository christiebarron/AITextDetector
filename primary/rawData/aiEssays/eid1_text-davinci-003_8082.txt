In the 1930s, the Empire State Building was a revolutionary construction project that captured the worldâ€™s imagination with its pioneering architectural design and engineering feats. This iconic structure also attracted attention due to its unique feature: the capacity to dock dirigibles, or airships, at its highest point. While the endeavor to make the Empire State Building capable of accommodating the docking of dirigibles was a daunting task, the project forces overcame a multitude of obstacles to make it a reality. 

The first obstacle to overcome was literally the top of the building itself. The mooring mast that would be necessary to allow dirigibles to anchor was 100-feet in length and had to be even taller than the entire building. The mast was designed to be slender and pointed due to wind resistance concerns, yet it still had to be strong enough to suspend large, heavyset airships. Additionally, the mast had to be light enough to put in place and anchored to the building. The architects and engineers managing the project created a far-reaching plan to ensure that the mast was up to the task. 

The mooring mast was built in Pennsylvania and circled with extra strong steel cables to handle the strain of suspending the dirigibles. Two derricks were used to lift the mast, which transported it from Pennsylvania as two separate pieces. The assembly of the mast was done with precision in alignment with the rooftop of the building. To ensure that the mooring
