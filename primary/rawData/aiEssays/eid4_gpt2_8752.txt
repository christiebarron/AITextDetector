The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the end-note is such a very well-crafted, almost comic ending. The entire book is dedicated to the story of one child who was a genius who was granted some very big and powerful powers by the mysterious, mysterious ruler. But his powers, as well as his true self-portrait, is just not that great. At the end, we discover that the ruler did not love him because of a story about what was really happening there in an alternate universe where he didn't have much luck, and that his real love was friendship.

I mean, I do not like anyof that stuff, but there is also a little bit of "love and power" in it that I think is interesting to us. And I think that is what I like that kind of kind of twist. I think it makes this book more of a mystery book because it means we know where they are and why they are there at all. It means we can be more sure that each of these children were born to a different prince. So it can also point to some deeper issues about the politics in some of these characters. I like the idea of finding out the truth behind what happened and how a certain prince took them on a little mission to prove he was a good Prince and help those kids who were so scared and turned against him that they didn't even know how to act and act, so that was a nice twist that is
