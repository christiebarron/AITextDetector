Computers have many effects on people. This means the more people you have, the easier it is for you to get on with the job.

It's important to understand that having more computers means having computers in different people's pockets. A computer that's used for research in your home can have just about anything you can think of. But, when compared to a home computer, the PC has several functions:

Supports basic graphics and multimedia support

Supports basic file synchronization and file synchronization functions (theoretically, only file-based applications have any ability to do this except reading data out of RAM)

Compiles and installs Linux and macOS

Launches Mac OSX and Windows

And other programs which perform similar functions.

In other words, Linux has many of the usual functions with respect to hardware. For example, it can run Mac OS X and Linux, it can perform basic file syncs (such as creating and downloading files), it can download files on its own, etc. Yet, when compared to a computer with a lot of computing power, the computer has fewer of these functions. So, it does need a lot of computing power.

So, a computer can offer a vast range. It might have multiple functions, it might offer a much more versatile computing environment, it might even want a desktop computer with a great display, some multimedia, some basic files synchronization software, some video and a variety of other software
