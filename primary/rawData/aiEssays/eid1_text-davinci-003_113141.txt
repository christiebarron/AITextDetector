Dear Editor,

In today's modern world, computers have become a significant and integral part of our lives. From communication to entertainment, computers are involved in every aspect of our lives. But the question that arises is whether this presence has a positive or negative effect on our lives.

I believe that the effects of computers on people are overwhelmingly positive. Computers have revolutionized the way we work, study, and find information. We are now able to get work done much more efficiently, and most of us can take on more tasks because of the help that computers provide. In addition, computers have enabled us to access information in an instant, giving us more tools to learn and grow as individuals.

However, as with any technology, computers come with potential risks. Too much technology can cause us to become disconnected from each other, creating social isolation and diminishing our interpersonal skills. We must remember to be cautious and aware of this issue.

Overall, computers have done more good than harm to our lives. By utilizing computers in responsible, safe, and productive ways, we can maximize their potential and reap all the benefits they have to offer.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
