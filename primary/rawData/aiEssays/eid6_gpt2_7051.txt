They either had to leave them fares at each foot or they could send them to the bridge instead of the other way around. The government officials said they were glad that the only way to avoid an embarrassing accident was not to dock at each foot.

One of the designers, Hernando Rodriguez, used "ghost ships" for ferrying up to five people. The company that built the Empire State Building also used "spoon-ship" dirigibles for transportation.

On the bridge's landing dock, the dirigibles were filled with air. They were placed in an elevated-height slot which could be used by any diver. On the side of the bridge had an air-filled landing zone of no less than 7 feet. But they were still covered with layers of a special material - a chemical compound known as Tephraac - they had been using for the past 5,000 years to hide the structure.

When they arrived in the state building, the workers brought them out to sea. One of the main features of the Empire State Building as depicted on the map was their large landing lot, which was connected with the Great Hall of the World by four high points, each with an enormous central landing lot. There was no water in the central landing lot and no air. Only a narrow, shallow stream of water could pass through the three-foot-wide,
