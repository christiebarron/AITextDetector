Computers have many effects on people. It's hard not to see why. Because I think that we're beginning to see the endgame of the brain changes that go on with it.

Now that we know how it happens, in the next few days, the research will show that there are many, many, many pathways from memory to cognition. Whether they use different pathways, I don't know. The research on cognition is really in the next year and a half, so we're very excited. We will definitely have to see many more experiments. It gets better.
