To whom it may concern,

As a concerned citizen, I feel the need to address the effects that computers have on people and our society. Computer technology has radically changed how we live in many ways, and its effects on people have been both positive and negative.

To start, the advancements in digital technology have opened many new doors, both in the workplace and in our everyday lives. For example, computers have had a major impact on our ability to learn and work efficiently. With the explosion of the internet, we now have access to vast amounts of information and communication capabilities. We can quickly and easily connect with people and resources all over the world.

Another positive effect that computers have had on people is the introduction of new tools and technologies that have made complex tasks easier. Computer-aided design (CAD) programs, for example, have made it easier and faster to design and build structures, vehicles, and other products. Automated tools have made it easier to diagnose and treat medical conditions, and computer simulations have been used to create new materials with better properties than those that exist naturally.

On the downside, computers can also have negative effects on people. Perhaps the largest concern is the rise of internet addiction, with many people spending hours each day surfing the web instead of engaging in real-world activities. Sitting in front of a computer for too long can also cause physical health problems, such as neck and back pain, as well as eyestrain
