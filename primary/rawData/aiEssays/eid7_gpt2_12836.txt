An example of a time someone in my life was patient was trying to talk about, or have to explain, or put down, or put down. But the one exception was my son's daughter, who was having a miscarriage. I was a little too late for that to have happened.

MARC: So the only way I know that there's a "probable cause" for having a miscarriage is if somebody told you. Or if they were a prosecutor, so maybe their information was passed onto them, but I don't understand how that could be.

You might feel like the one thing that would be in line with that is to say there must be a miscarriage out there if that person is telling you.
