As technology advances, the effects computers have on people become more conspicuous. While some may argue that computers are helpful tools in our lives, I am of the opinion that their use often leads to more negative results.

The use of computers has a variety of harmful influences on people. For instance, an over reliance on computers can decrease our motivation and creativity. Using computers as a crutch to solve problems can stunt our growth as creative thinkers. Furthermore, excessive use of computers has been linked to conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, myopia, and obesity due to lessened physical activity.

Furthermore, there is an increased threat of cyberbullying. With social media platforms becoming the basis of many interactions between peers, hateful or hurtful messages can spread quickly, with potentially dangerous consequences for recipients. Increased computer use also promotes a lifestyle of multitasking, which studies have found to be an ineffective way to learn and remember information.
