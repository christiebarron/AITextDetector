In 1930, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique task: allowing dirigibles to dock at the world’s tallest building. This was an ambitious and complex project, fraught with a number of obstacles that threatened the successful completion of the project.

First of all, figuring out the physical structure of the docking mast was a difficult problem. The mast had to be solid and sturdy in order to support the weight of the dirigible, while also being aerodynamic enough not to interfere with the airship’s ability to maneuver. "The mast used to tie up the dirigible had to be a marvel of engineering, tall enough to reach above the height of the building but slender enough to not be buffeted in the wind." To address this challenge, the engineers designed a 150 foot tall steel mast that was 8 feet in diameter.

The engineers also had to consider the wind currents at the top of the building. It was important that the mast be positioned in an area that did not have a great deal of wind gusts in order to make it easier for the dirigible pilot to maneuver and dock the airship. To address this challenge, the engineers used a weather balloon to measure the wind currents in order to determine where to position the mast.

Finally, the engineers had to consider the landing gear for the dirigible. The landing gear had to be designed to allow the dirigible to dock safely and securely without causing damage to the mast
