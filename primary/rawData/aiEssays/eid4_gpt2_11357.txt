The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it asks all of us to work in close collaboration. My mission is simple: To build a book that captures everything in the book, and with it, one of the world's greatest and most important stories of the past century.

If you can, consider supporting my work through these pledges and sharing it with your friends. And thanks for reading!
