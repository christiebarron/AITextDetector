Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The main change I saw during the review were a number of things. One that started to happen was that bikes in a particular zone are now considered 'fairly safe' or 'pre-approved' by cyclists and those who live there must adhere to the local bike safety guidelines in order to be allowed to access a suitable cycling park.

This rule was also very important for local residents as their roads were 'lowroad' or "road-limited".

Many people felt that this was an unfair regulation that would take away their cycling opportunities. So many people were saying that thereل� were no restrictions on bicycle access on roads for cyclists or non-bicycle users.

The result of this decision was an extra 40km of bike lane on the street to help with those cycling at their best.

The number of cyclists who were able to ride this extra distance is one of the highlights. We've reached a new and encouraging goal that can mean more and more for all cyclists in our country.

We hope all of you would like our new feature to help you set up a cycling park that is fit, safe, and enjoyable for your riding

We will continue providing cycling park options for you to enjoy - and continue to build on the progress we've already made with road-limited cycling, including a dedicated bicycle centre within our office and some of the bike
