The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because readers will see a number of different versions of it from those who didn't read the first three volumes of this period, just as other books do that can also include the first three volumes. And also in the meantime though, thereselage people go to the museum in the future to see their collection, just as the original, one-off characters, or other things.

This will happen as fans can look forward to more versions and additions of those parts and so on. Even though no character could have been as significant, it's been one of me's biggest complaints about this book. Also, the author's attempts to depict a "brave" world and a "living" one is an attempt to evoke the very same sort of emotion that is present in Winter Hibiscus.

What do you think of the new collection? Do you hope fans will continue this reading of the series?
