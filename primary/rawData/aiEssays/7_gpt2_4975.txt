An example of a time someone in my life was patient was Dr. Harry Potter, who was diagnosed with Down's Syndrome but later successfully treated for Down's. However, when I was doing my PhD, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, and I had to give an evaluation to see if I'd still be able to talk down to his wheelchair. So, I had to find the cause of my own disability and make sure I'd always speak to him.
To learn about other people who are experiencing a similar condition, please visit our Dyslexia page.
It is very important to understand that the more people understand and understand disabilities to the degree required, the better off the planet will be.
But many people are also suffering from a mental disorder like schizophrenia. It is also easier for some people to relate with someone who has a different vision or hearing than to know that they can hear just fine when looking at him.
So just because people with a mental disorder can communicate is not the norm.
Also, some people might just be not getting it – or maybe not giving it – as to why other people can see things, and why some people can talk only a bit.
So, being able to learn about people's other senses and their unique needs is very appreciated by everyone. It is not something to be ridiculed!
