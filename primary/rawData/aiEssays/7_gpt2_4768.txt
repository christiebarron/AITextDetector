An example of a time someone in my life was patient was this girl I've named Elizabeth. I'm pretty sure that Elizabeth worked at an elementary school in my neighborhood and just when she got to town I sent a note to her that I'd like to come home. I mean, she loved to eat. I texted her, 'I love you so much. Please let me walk you home tonight, please,' just so I'm clear on the exact time to be here. So, at the elementary school that she worked at I have to pass on a lot of that stuff for Elizabeth. She's not a typical nurse, she's an honest person. She doesn't feel pressured by anyone. Statements from other teachers, her family. I don't even know anyone.

If you ever wanted to talk to her, I'm going to show you what I have out here in here. It's my favorite memory. I met someone over in Mexico just over a few years ago. If you ever wanted to talk to her, I'm not regularly up here.

When you have your own stuff and you were having great fun. You had some hot tubs sitting there and no water. You had a picnic table and lots of food lying around. It's just kind of what you did in the summer.
