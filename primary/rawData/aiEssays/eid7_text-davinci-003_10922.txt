I was at the grocery store the other day when I noticed a huge line. I had to wait over an hour to check out. Instead of getting frustrated or angry, I decided to stay patient. I put on a podcast to pass the time and chatted with the people around me. I also appreciated the efficiency of the cashiers and made sure to thank them for their hard work. It wasn't easy to stand in line for so long, but I kept my cool and was thankful for a chance to practice patience.
