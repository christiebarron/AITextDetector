Computers have many effects on people. Some people may need to start looking for new jobs or start moving around. Others, such as the homeless or the elderly, will often stay in the community long enough to get their life started. But the cost of living is a greater problem for people who depend on other people for basic needs.

"There's a very serious and serious issue," said Lipsack. "One of our very strong points is the lack of a viable workforce. You can't take a lot of workers like this and make sure they're trained as quickly as possible with the right skills, the right experience.

"But if our country as a whole gets seriously strapped and we don't have adequate money for housing, we're going to have very long hours of unemployment. That's really critical. And, as my friend Mark Renshaw's book put it, 'when you don't have access to the people who are going to make the difference for you at the end of the day, it's incredibly difficult.' So what we have to do is be the responsible thing to do. When they find out, that we're just not going to do a good job, that we're not going to invest the right money."
