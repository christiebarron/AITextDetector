Dear Editor,

As our world continues to advance, technology has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. Computers are one of the most prominent forms of technology, and they have had a significant impact on society. While some may argue that computers offer a variety of positive benefits, I believe that they have had a mostly negative effect.

The first major negative effect of computers is the impact on interpersonal relationships. People often rely on computers for communication and socializing, yet there is a lack of real face-to-face connection which can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. Furthermore, people who use computers excessively can become addicted, leading to a depletion of their motivation and productivity.

Another negative consequence of computers is that they can take away jobs from people who can do the same tasks without them. For example, many businesses are using computers to replace customer service representatives. This means fewer jobs for people who need them, leading to an increase in unemployment and economic inequality.

Lastly, computers are taking away people’s ability to think for themselves. With the influx of information available online, people often don’t think for themselves and rely solely on the information they find on the internet. This harms people’s critical thinking skills and limits their problem solving abilities.

In conclusion, computers can be considered beneficial tools, but they have had a mostly negative effect on people. Therefore, it is proposed that society learns to use them more responsibly and
