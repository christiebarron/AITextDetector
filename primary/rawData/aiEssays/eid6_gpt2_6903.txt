The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The new, high efficiency, rotary crane, is designed to move a ton of wood and other materials out the building and the crane's rotary arm restates on rails to hold the entire building onto its concrete front floor.

"It was quite a challenge that I had to overcome, not just to keep the building going as much as possible. As such, we decided, using the large central hub of our building, not only would it help to separate them, but it would also prevent people from getting to the bridge, just to make that move with less hassle," says Bill Schuhler, one of the architects behind the project. "The building will stand up to that challenge now, and have an added value and stability after."

The crane, built by KPMG in 2012, also will be able to perform emergency repairs to the front building, allowing for better use of the building as a museum or school building by adults.

Backed by American Architects, American Bridge conquest is also designed to bring high quality services and entertainment that have only come from the American dream to the world.

"I think having the ability to do a lot more that will be extremely important [to us] because we want the ability to showcase our building in a way that is truly fun and different from everything else that we've seen in this building before," Schuhler says
