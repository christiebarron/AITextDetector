Dear Editor:

Since their invention, computers have had an undeniably powerful effect on society, and the debate about the positive and negative effects that computers have on people continues today.

On the one hand, computers can be beneficial in many ways. For instance, they can improve communication between people by allowing for faster and more efficient data exchange. Additionally, machines can increase efficiency at work, reducing wasted time and effort. Furthermore, the availability of online educational resources has made it easier for people to gain knowledge and become more informed.

On the other hand, computers can also have a negative effect on us. People have become increasingly dependent on technology for their day-to-day lives, and they may struggle to complete basic tasks without a computer. Furthermore, the excessive use of technology can lead to an even more sedentary lifestyle, which has been linked to numerous health issues such as obesity and heart disease.

In conclusion, it is clear that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. However, if used and regulated responsibly, computers can be a powerful tool to enhance the lives of many. I strongly believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh their potential drawbacks and it is our responsibility as citizens to ensure that these tools are used properly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
