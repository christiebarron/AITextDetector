Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. A lot of people think of road travel and think it's all about staying right ahead of the road - what a thrill at the end of a dangerous stretch and no real danger when you turn right. This idea is not backed up by what we saw in some of our own racing, however.

This particular challenge comes after the early racing in 2016. The team started in a tough first part, but then lost a few races to a team that had much more of a lead then. It went from a low point to a solid top half in less than three races. What's really worrying is that the team's pace came off a cliff this year, which is understandable because they were not prepared to push this new high to the top. We really have to take them at face value over the next two or three races and then put the final stop.

A car can't see a straight line but it can sense a break and make some mistakes. It's the only way we can win and this weekend we have a shot over that straight line.

"Even here in Australia we have to focus on getting through and trying to make the final 10 or so laps on the test track in the top eight to get into qualifying."

And it will not be easy. At the moment, even drivers with the best lap time have all the advantages of the traditional top four. Teams
