I was on vacation with my family when I witnessed one of the most special moments I have ever seen. My brother was playing pranks on the whole family when he noticed my aunt, who had a kind of sadness in her eyes. Without a second though he walked straight up to her and handed her two tickets to the circus that had come to town that week.

My aunt had never been to a circus before and was reluctant to go, but my brother knew just what she needed. He joked about what kind of clowns we'd see there and what silly tricks they would play. Every time my aunt tried to refuse, my brother was quick to add a joke or two. Eventually, with a burst of laughter that lit up the room, my aunt agreed to go with us all to the circus.

At the circus, the two of them had an absolute blast. This normally shy and solemn aunt was laughing and clapping her hands with joy as a clown tried to exercise a bear to fit into an oversized bathing suit. It was an incredibly special moment to see my brother helping my aunt come out of her shell like that. The sheer amount of joy I felt to be around them was overwhelming, and it's something I will never forget.
