I was volunteering at a primary school and the day had been quite chaotic; children were running around, screaming and it felt like no one was taking any notice. I was trying to help out as much as I could but I was feeling overwhelmed.

Then, one of the children came up to me in tears. He had managed to tear his shirt and was embarrassed to go back to class in that state. I knew how much it would mean to him if I could help him get it fixed, so I set out to do just that.

I searched the school and managed to find some spare material that I could use to patch up the shirt. I was about to hand it over when I noticed that the spare material was a different color to the shirt he was wearing. If I gave it to him without warning, he would feel embarrassed and out of place in class.

So instead, I sat with him patiently and explained that the material was different but that he didn't need to worry about it. I assured him that everyone gets embarrassed sometimes and that everybody would understand.

He seemed much calmer after I had spoken with him and I was able to patch up his shirt and return it to him in perfect condition. His smile when I gave it back made all my effort worthwhile.

This experience taught me the importance of being patient in difficult situations and I am now much more likely to take a step back and assess the situation first before responding.
