One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was working with an electric light bulb to turn one of my lamps in a dark room into an electric light bulb to turn a light into a lamp I had no idea I was getting so much. This is what it was like: I was in such a rush to turn the light on that it started to burn me, and I could hear it in the hallway all the time. Then I turned the light back on and it was completely silent. Even when I started laughing I didn't think anyone at work had actually heard me. Finally I realized that this was the end of all of me getting serious."

On his return home, Mr. Hager added, "I just needed some other things like a book for myself, a bottle of wine to wash my eyes and help me get through the day on the bus, and a computer. It was my goal to get out of college. The only thing I can think of to be able to do now is learn how to do things on your own. It was just a tough trip."
