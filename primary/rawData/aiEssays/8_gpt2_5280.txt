One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a cute baby boy play. This isn't my favorite scene (this is not even close).


So for this moment I am going to break it down as follows (this is part one of two in the series).


I was watching a movie and my friend was standing next to me with a bottle of milk. She looked at me and said, "Mom, I've got a baby girl!"


She immediately took a sip of milk. He looked at me and said in a puzzled tone, "You must be really hungry, Mom." I looked over at him and a voice came over my ear like a man trying to push a pin into an object. I just looked up and saw that I had missed him.


I was shocked. I had not realized how excited he was about my daughter for some time. I immediately told him he had given her a bottle of milk. "He asked her if she was hungry, and I asked her what she thought about her mom," he said in a sad voice.


I felt so lucky. This one is the end of that story.


I am not going to go ahead and go through all of the time that goes by without mentioning some story that I have said. You are always welcome in my book.


So my list of some of my favorite moments from my life at the beginning of the series is as follows:
