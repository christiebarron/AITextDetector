At the end of the poem, the speaker is reflecting on the hardships of being an immigrant and struggling to adjust to a new culture. The speaker is most likely referring to taking a test to become a United States citizen. The speaker is reflecting on the hope that they will find success in their new life when the hibiscus, a symbol of vibrant life, returns in the spring.
