The ending of Winter Hibiscus is symbolic of transformation and change. The hibiscus symbolizes the main character's journey, as she is growing and changing throughout the story. The idea of taking the test again as the hibiscus buds again is a sign that the test is not only about knowledge and understanding of the material, but also about transformation and growth. It is a sign that the character has grown and is ready to take the same test in a different way with a different perspective.
