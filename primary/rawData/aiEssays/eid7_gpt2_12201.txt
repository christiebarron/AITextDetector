An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I would pick on them for any of their things. I was so angry when they were too late for my family. There was so much for them to do.

How do you think your friends are responding now?

At present it's a bit different. I had been through a lot of adversity and trying to recover and get my mind back to the game-playing my days at North Carolina. Hopefully I can make it back in life and contribute really quickly towards my goals before the year has even started. I also just like the idea of playing and being a part of that.
