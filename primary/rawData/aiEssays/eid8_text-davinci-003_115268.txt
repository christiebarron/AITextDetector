I remember the first time I met my best friend. We had both recently moved to a new city and were starting at a new school. I was a bit nervous and the only thing we had in common was our classes.

As I walked into the main lobby of the school I noticed her standing off to the side. I could tell she was feeling a bit overwhelmed as well. I decided to take a chance and walk up to introduce myself.

I nervously said “Hi, I’m Jessica” and at the same time she said “ Hi, I’m Maria”. We both started laughing and it felt really natural. The feeling of laughter just kept flowing between us. We knew right away that we’d become really good friends.

We stayed together like two peas in a pod from that day forward and it was almost always filled with laughter. Even when times were tough we could always find something to laugh about.

That moment when we first laughed together will always stay with me and I’m thankful to have a friend like Maria in my life who can always bring a smile to my face.
