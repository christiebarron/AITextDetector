Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. A low road ahead will be harder for the cyclist to travel - more time for the cyclist to think of its path. The wider of the roads of the city will also be harder to navigate, more difficult for the cyclist to see where he wants to be and more difficult for the cyclist to find a safe, visible road.

'Rough Road Ahead' will also provide a sense of which roads are more or less safe, with the exception of some roads between different parts of the city such as the main motorways. This will also help to inform the judgement of the cyclist about the safest routes before embarking for the road, given the differences in the use and location of vehicles and roads (which is important with urban roads). The ability of the user to choose the different roads in 'Rough Road Ahead' is also important. In order to determine what roads will take the cyclist to, say, one of the four key roads listed on the map - one for the north and one for the south - the user can use the following algorithm, based on feedback from riders over several months, to predict the location of the different roads in the area and the direction they take towards the next round of voting. The key outcome is that road choices in two of four communities will take the bike to the most convenient road and those in one of only three communities will take the cycle to the simplest road.
