I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an act of political correctness," said N.D.J. Council member Joe Chinn. "I would urge government regulators to prohibit any expression on university facilities regarding the library's activities."

In an appearance at the University of Michigan's faculty and staff meeting in early October, Staviano defended a decision by Penn State to prohibit nude photos and videotapes of the school's athletic department. In a statement, he said Penn State has been "fully cooperative" with the university in its handling of the case.

"We have had the opportunity to talk with representatives of the Penn State Association of Libraries about this matter, and we felt it was important that the board's decision was followed," he said. "At the University of Michigan, a place of scholarly inquiry is required for any public inquiry and there is no exemption for universities based on what other publications are considered politically incorrect."

The move came after the Pennsylvania Department of Licensing and Regulation issued an alert last month warning that images of the university were being posted on internet forums. At the time, the university's office was still working to determine if the policy had anything to do with nudity on campus grounds.

N.D.J. Council member Joe Chinn says he hopes the university's decision will encourage more public involvement in schools in the wake of sexual assault charges filed against sexual assault survivor Lauren Graham and others. (Photo: Scott Eisenberg, The (Mil
