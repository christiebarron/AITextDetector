Wistful nostalgia, joy, and healing sorrow permeate the memoir, creating a bittersweet atmosphere.

Rodriguez's vivid descriptions of his beloved family, of his father in particular, generate a bittersweet atmosphere of nostalgia and unique fondness. In recalling these memories, Rodriguez also reflects on his hometown with fondness, illustrating a deep capacity to both appreciate and bemoan what it means to make our homes part of who we are. There is a deep wonderment in rediscovering the beauty of his childhood home; while as a young man he has sought to escape the limitations of his home, Rodriguez nevertheless pays homage to those “very little things that make the world you want to stay in”.

The melancholic atmosphere in From Home is also highlighted by Rodriguez’s interweaving of family tragedies throughout the memoir. As he reflects on the injustices of his parents’ lives, the reader is pulled into the realities of his family’s hardships. His reflections not only showcase the realities of their lives, but also point to the indelible strength of the family to persevere
