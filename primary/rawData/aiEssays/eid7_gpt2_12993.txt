An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she went in my office as a patient's assistant and her job was to hold up an MRI to determine when brain tumors were forming around her neck.

The patient in my office and I both amd asked the physician to do a study on her and how she had become resistant to such an intervention. The doctors had known nothing. My concern is that her immune system worked itself into a defensive war footing with the patient and her physician to maintain the war effort after they had determined that there was no way she was being exposed to radiation. I don't know what you have done with all this information but it reminds me of an experiment that has turned out fairly well:

In an early 1990's era, a single patient who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had been in remission at the time of her diagnosis was sent out to a treatment facility with a new neurological treatment and she found that her brain tumor was being spread to all of her organs.

When she got there her doctor decided to take the new treatment and send her there but once there was no response she left and her symptoms began to worsen. She began to feel "lush" and it was very, very cold, her heart rate was going, and in some cases she would have a seizure when she couldn't breath or speak for about 30 seconds at a time. She was hospitalized and eventually died.

Her body was not even able to breathe
