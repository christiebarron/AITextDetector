I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, websites, and at local or national level is necessary to ensure that the freedom of speech and expression will not be curtailed. Those who support the right of freedom of expression, such as our elected officials, should also stand up to the demands of the citizens of their districts," the speech said.

The bill has been introduced by the Left on the grounds that it has the "power to create a world based on individual freedom, where all people will be free to express themselves and to express their ideas, ideas and views," the Constitution said, adding that it does not impose any restrictions on freedom of expression for "in the country of their birth, their citizenship or where they live."

In other words, the Constitution does not apply to content on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter.

The legislation is being introduced by representatives from two state-held political parties, the Progressive Alliance and the Democratic Party of India (PDI). The PIL, under a draft law brought in in February, does not extend to content on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.
