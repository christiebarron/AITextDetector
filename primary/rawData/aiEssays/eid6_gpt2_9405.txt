The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represents the builders of both skyscrapers, cited First Amendment violations in a lawsuit by the builders' owner, Paul R. Trenberth.

The two builders are using two different designs for the new building, while the Metropolitan Opera Company (MOC) has two versions and uses the same architecture. Moc uses both of the two buildings and says they're not as good as the one inside the former Tower of London.

The two developers say they believe they can make the same building at Moc.

The New York City borough attorney asked Judge Charles A. Alsup to intervene.

According to Judge Alsup, they'll likely use the other proposed building in the case to show that they have the public's permission to build a skyscraper from scratch. In other words, they've just given them something they've already built, and not the public is allowed to use.

"When the building does receive public approval—when it starts with the public's express approval—then it's free-riding in that way, as a builder of skyscrapers," Alsup said. "It's not a public program. This is a business model. It requires us to put our business here for everyone."
