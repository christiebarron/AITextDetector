The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by actor Michael Caine – who plays the role of a father to her son in the action-thriller — had a direct connection to the character of Burt Reynolds, the father he is, as the former leader of the "pro-homosexual movement" and the father of the present president.

Writing in The Telegraph shortly after the shootings, he said: "While the father to our son might be the kind of role which some anti-gay campaigners might prefer to place on the movie screen, it's not the role as he seems – or should be – to stand by in an anti-gay battle.

"The movie is about that."

It is this, and his support for gay rights, which the filmmaker believes are being ignored in the recent media coverage of the attacks in Paris, which he has now used as a publicity ploy.

I have to respect your point. But the idea that the family of a prominent gay actor, from the 1940s to '45s, should be celebrated is not something which can be taken seriously with the kind of attention to which the anti-gay campaigner has been given.

And it may be that you find it more of a "gotcha" than a success, since as you know your son, Oscar Wilde, was not only gay, he was a rooted-father figure, as far as anti-gay activists are concerned.
