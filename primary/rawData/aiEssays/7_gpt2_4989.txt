An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the first time I met my therapist. This one was with me, and the first place that he told me about it was in my book, where she told me what she would ask me about therapy and how she wouldn't be in the business of telling the truth about therapy anymore. We had met before, and he was saying "You're in the business of telling the truth about therapy," so when I started talking to his story and seeing him talk to a lot of people that were not aware about it, I was hooked. It was the absolute best therapy with no side effects. This therapy had a couple of other benefits that were different, and my family and I were both very proud of it. My family was pretty supportive of it, too.

Karen: I don't remember any of that stuff on a regular basis; it's not like someone's actually going straight here. They just want to hear it and say, "Oh, what an amazing healing process we're about! What a wonderful experience!" I mean, just in my life I am always in the best shape that I've ever been, and that's the kind of thing that I try to build up on every day. We spend a lot of time together and talk about how amazing healing can be, really. And I feel like it's probably the most empowering thing
