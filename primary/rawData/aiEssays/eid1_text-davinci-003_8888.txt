I had been out of the country for almost a year, working on a project in India. I had been gone for so long, and had no idea what had changed at home.

My friends had all gathered for a welcome home party, and I was nervous about how it was all going to go. I just wanted everything to go smoothly.

I arrived at the house and everyone was already there. I nervously made my way to the group, but my friends were all talking and laughing together as if there hadn't been a year apart. 

That was when it hit me: during the time I was away, none of us had changed. We were all still the same. We had all grown, but our ability to laugh together was still the same. 

Before I knew it, I found myself joining in their laughter. It was a reminder of how much I had missed all of them. I felt so grateful to be surrounded by old friends who hadn't changed.

We had all changed in a way during my absence, but our ability to laugh together was, and still is, a constant in our friendship. No matter how long apart, it always reminds me of how lucky I am to be surrounded by such amazing friends.
