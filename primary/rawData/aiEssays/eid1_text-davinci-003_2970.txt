Dear Editor,

As the world becomes more reliant on information technology, computers are becoming an increasingly important part of our lives. While computers are undoubtedly useful tools that can make life easier and open up a host of new opportunities, they can also have potentially negative effects on people.

One of the most obvious downfalls related to computers is the amount of time spent in front of screens. With more and more people working from home due to the pandemic, you can hardly go a day without seeing someone glued to their laptop or tablet. This can be detrimental to both physical and mental health. When using computers, some may forget to take breaks, engage in physical activity, and spend quality time with their loved ones. 

Moreover, computers can distort a personâ€™s view of reality. With more people interacting through screens and having virtual social circles, real-world relationships can suffer. People can be more inclined to compare themselves with others on social media, leading to self-doubt and negative self-image. 

That said, computers are still an incredibly important part of our lives and have the potential to do so much good. However, people should be mindful of the effects these machines can have on them
