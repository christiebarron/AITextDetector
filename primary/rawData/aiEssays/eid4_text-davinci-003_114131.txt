At the beginning of the poem, the narrator expresses her apprehension about a test she is about to take. This test is a metaphor for a challenge or obstacle that she faces in her life. The narrator chooses to focus on a hibiscus flower in her garden as a source of comfort and strength, "for I am strong, like them" she says. 

The narrator is confident that she will succeed in this test, but she feels the need to reaffirm her courage and strength. She uses the hibiscus to represent her strength and resilience. By ending with the thought that she will take the test again when the hibiscus is in full bloom, symbolizing her strength, the narrator is emphasizing the idea that she has the courage to face and overcome her obstacle.
