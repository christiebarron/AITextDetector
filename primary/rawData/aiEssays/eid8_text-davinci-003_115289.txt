I remember the first time I ever really made my best friend laugh. We were in the middle of a heated argument about politics, so the situation was pretty tense. But when I started to make a joke about the situation, she couldn't help herself and started laughing. Before I knew it, both of us were hysterically laughing. It was embarrassing, because we were right in the middle of the college library, but it was also a really special moment for the both of us. I'm so glad that both of us could just let go and relax in that moment. From that point forward, laughter was a regular part of our friendship. We would often joke and banter back and forth in a good-natured way, and it created an even stronger bond between us. To this day, it's still one of the moments that I cherish most about our friendship.
