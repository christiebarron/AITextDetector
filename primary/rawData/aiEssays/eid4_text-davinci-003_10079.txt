The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is symbolic of the protagonist's inner resiliency. The struggles faced by the protagonist throughout the novel become a metaphor for her own internal challenges. The protagonist, who has experienced failure and heartache, portrays the idea that acceptance of her past and the hope of a better future in spite of the circumstances, is what will ultimately propel her forward. The line 'When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?' is symbolic of the protagonist's promise to herself that she will strive for better and take the 'test' of life—with all of its obstacles and successes—again and again; ultimately, with hope of success.
