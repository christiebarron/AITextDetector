The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it also gives a great introduction to a lot of the mysteries that were hidden in the film by the fans.

The film features a big cast of characters and a strong story arc. The cast includes a couple of heroes of some unknown origin who help them to recover from what was left of their pasts. The film includes a couple of great scenes of friendship, romance and war, when the hero is rescued and given the chance to be more than mere pawn at the game of hockey.

The film also features an extensive cast of actors such as Samira Pico (Murdoch), Alain (Kung Fu), Robert E Lee (Inner Throat), Michael Eisler (The Shining), Roxy Reiffle (The BFG), David Fincher (Moonrise Kingdom), Kevin Costner (American Horror Story: Hotel and The Dying Girl), Max Brooks (The Revenant), and Paul Czaja≈Çko (The Martian).
