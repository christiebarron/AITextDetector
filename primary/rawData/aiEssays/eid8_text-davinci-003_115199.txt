I'll never forget the time my best friend and I spent together at our favorite ice cream shop. We'd been best friends for years and the only time we could get together was after school on Fridays. It had already been a long day and neither of us was in a great mood. 

As we walked down the street to the ice cream shop, we passed a man who was walking his dog. His pup suddenly stopped, stared at us, and then started barking ferociously. My friend and I were startled and started to laugh. It was one of those moments when laughter was the only way to cope with a situation. It was a kind of nervous laughter shared by two people who were both confused but not scared.

When we reached the ice cream shop, we only had a few dollars to share. We decided to split a scoop of ice cream between the two of us. No matter how hard we tried, our scooper just couldn't make it look even. As we stood there, poking and prodding at the scoop with our spoons, we started cracking jokes about how unfair it was. The more we joked, the more we laughed. In the end, we gave up and decided to just split it into two parts however we could manage. We ended up with lopsided scoops but we couldn't stop laughing.

Although our night didn't last very long, it was amazing. We couldn't keep the laughter out of
