The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there are some very powerful and unusual characters to explore.

But if you don't think I'm exaggerating, you shouldn't have missed out on the book's world. As well as introducing the mystery with a lot of cool, intriguing new stuff, this book was also a great time to see how well this book handles fantasy and science fiction.
