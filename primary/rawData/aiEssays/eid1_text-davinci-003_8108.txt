The Empire State Building was completed in 1931, and the idea to build a mooring mast for dirigibles seemed like it would be the perfect solution to bring in people from all over the world who wished to come and visit this majestic skyscraper that rose 1,250 feet from the skyline of New York City. Unfortunately, the task of mooring a large airship to the mast of this skyscraper was met with many obstacles, as the technology behind it was not quite there yet.

The building of the mooring mast required structural modifications to the Empire State Building. The building already had a powerful broadcast antenna located at the top of the building, and adding the mooring mast on the top of the building would require reinforcement of the buildingâ€™s structure to bear the increased load of the mast. Furthermore, the mooring mast had to be of a specific height in order to enable the dirigible to dock properly, and this height also had to be compatible with the height of the Empire State Building.

In addition, the technology needed to maneuver the airship was still largely unproven at the time. The dirigible had to be capable of traveling in various directions without having to constantly adjust its mooring lines, which was a complex engineering challenge that had to be addressed. Furthermore, the mooring mast itself was designed in such a way that if a gust of wind pushed the airship off course, it would be automatically enabled
