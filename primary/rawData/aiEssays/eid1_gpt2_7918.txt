Computers have many effects on people. But one of the most surprising is the way people think about those effects.

A study conducted by the research team used a model of people on a computer and showed that people with schizophrenia could be more interested in the effects of schizophrenia than the people with mild depression, an illness that affects only 50 per cent of people.

They thought there was something wrong with the brains of these people when they saw these images.

Researchers did a real experiment looking at schizophrenia in healthy people, who were assignedRusso's face with a face mask. This created an extremely clear impression on the brain of the patients, who were then asked who had higher risk of schizophrenic symptoms.

They found the patients who had their faces shaved off to look more like normal faces could have higher risk of schizoaffective disorder.

These people are actually actually different from the schizophrenic people of the original study group â€“ they are more likelier to have depression. Now, although the new study didn't find a link between the two conditions, they also showed the patients with schizophrenia had the highest level of mental health problems.

Because they didn't have any extra tests to check their symptoms, the men and women who had their faces shaved off had the highest rate of schizoaffective disorder.

So the people with schizophrenia weren't necessarily suffering as much from the symptoms they actually had.
