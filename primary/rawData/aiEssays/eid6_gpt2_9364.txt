The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Unlike the "Climb" on the Empire State Building, dirigibles can only be placed by the pilot of a craft capable of landing on the roof over the aircraft. That means an airplane that is being towed to a lower deck could drag into other buildings if a single building is not used, and a building which contains a car could be towed and used as a dumping area for scrap cargo and other small items. Also, the pilot is able to use the pilot's radio to determine if a building is under construction and can pick up anything from there.

For a cockpit-mounted dirigible pilot, many different types of aerodynamic and weightlessness restrictions were imposed on the pilot. In general, the airframers had to offer both vertical and horizontal and wind speeds ranging from 10,000 to 200,000 mph. While the pilot has limited maneuver maneuverability and is not able to use the airplane in tandem, he can use his primary airplane to perform lateral and vertical passageways by "cabering" around a pilot in the air.

The Star Wars and Star Wars universe (and even other space shows and movies) depict aircraft as a series of twin-mission craft. Each was designed and built with much more weight on its back and with some of it lost on its long haul. In an effort to reduce the weight of the aircraft while maintaining maneuverability,
