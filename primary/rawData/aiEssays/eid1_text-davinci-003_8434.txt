I remember that one time my best friend's mother found out that her son had failed a very important exam. His mother was obviously very angry and disappointed, but she kept her composure and waited for him to explain the situation. She listened intently and patiently to her son and when all had been said, she was still visibly upset but she managed to hold her emotions back. She calmly told him that he should have done better but then went on to say that she was still very proud of him and the effort he had all put in. She reminded him that as long as he put in his best effort, she would always stand by him and still love him no matter what. 

I was very impressed and taken aback at how much patience and understanding her mother had. Even though her son had let her down, she still managed to show him her love and compassion. It was a stark contrast to the situation that I might have been in had I been in the same position. I think her patience was truly inspiring and it made me reflect on my own lack of patience in hard times.
