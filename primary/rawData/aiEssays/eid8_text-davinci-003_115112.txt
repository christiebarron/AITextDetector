I remember one particular day many years ago that always makes me smile when I look back on it. It was a hot summer day and I was in town with my best friend at a carnival. We wandered around, eating food and playing games, laughing and having a great time.

At one point, we decided to take a break and sit down on one of the benches. We were surrounded by some other people who, in hindsight, were probably pretty shady characters. As we relaxed on the bench, we heard one of them across from us mumbling to himself. Suddenly, he stopped and stared straight at us. We both looked at each other with a mix of confusion and amusement as he pointed at us and shouted "Ha ha ha!"

We both burst into laughter at his sudden outburst and even the shady characters around us were chuckling. After a few moments, we caught our breath and thanked him for the unexpected yet welcomed interlude. He gave us a nod and continued mumbling to himself, yet we still managed to exchange a few more laughs with him before we continued on our way. 

To this day, I never forgot that moment and the laughter that filled the air. Life is so much better with a bit of laughter in it, and I'm so glad I got to experience it with one of my oldest friends.
