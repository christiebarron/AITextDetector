Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology advances, so does our reliance on computers. I believe that, although computers offer us convenience, they have the potential to cause physical and mental detriments if used excessively. 

Studies have found that long periods of sitting in front of a computer screen can lead to an array of physical problems like carpal tunnel syndrome, eye strain, and obesity. In fact, for those in the workforce, overestimating the number of hours spent working in an office can create a serious health issue. Therefore, it is important for those spending too much time on the computer to take regular breaks or seek out an ergonomic chair.

Those that spend an unhealthy amount of time wired in also risk developing mental health issues and problems with relationships. Spending too much time online can cause screen addiction, making users feel anxious and isolated. It can also lead to problems forming meaningful relationships with others in face to face social situations.

Given the potential physical and mental effects of computers, it is important to be mindful of the amount of time spent in front of a screen. We need to utilize the convenient aspects of the technology without risking our health in the process. I encourage readers to take active steps to ensure that their access to computers is cognitively and physically beneficial. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
