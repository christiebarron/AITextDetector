One time I experienced laughter in my life was when she tried to take down my shirt. She tried to tell me to look at my boobs or something -- to try to calm down. But I just went, "Yeah, okay, let me come on over" and began to push forward and pull her shirt down down. I guess you could say it was funny because I am wearing it. It was a tight little knot, so I just had to let it just slide down the side of my body. Even then, when she pulled it up at the same time I started to gasp, she knew it was happening and it wasn't happening. But I knew I was going to have to be patient, to try to get something back, because now I am at the stage where I have so much more in me because of this injury."

I'm so blessed, I would say at times that the thing I loved most a lot about all this is that there's a lot more of you here (even though, at times, you have more power, more control.) I find this kind of humor to be hard to get used to. But it still comes back to me. It's hard when I am on the court, I was so excited before I played. It's always felt really amazing to feel and even play a part in something like this. I just want to say, no, this is not for all of us. This is for all of us in our careers
