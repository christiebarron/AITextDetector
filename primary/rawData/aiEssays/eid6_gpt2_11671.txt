The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They were trying to convince their customers to install large windows on the walls, because a new type of canopy would allow them to use large displays, unlike "puffy" windows available on windows at the National Cathedral in the mid-forties. The government refused to make their system available to public order officials who couldn't afford more costly components to build and maintain new facilities. The federal government had even more power to control how these new designs could be used. Then, under pressure from the private sector, the government tried to use the same kind of canopy, called a glass "shield," for airplanes. Then, the government allowed airplanes to operate in public places.

The U.S. Coast Guard had a special interest in this kind of flying system. Its chief of staff had the foresight to stop it as early as 1959 with Operation EZ-1, an attempt to save the Coast Guard a tremendous loss because it would allow the U.S. Navy to buy up any planes built by the FAA. Unfortunately, even then it didn't work. As we know by now, the Coast Guard used other forms of aircraft called "shields" to stop airplanes from flying with government ships. The new commercial airliners and aircraft capable of carrying 1 to 6 people weren't suitable for commercial operation. If they were, they would just have to crash into or crash into a power plant or dock
