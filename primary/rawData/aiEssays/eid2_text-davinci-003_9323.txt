In recent years, the debate surrounding the censorship of material in libraries has become increasingly contentious. While some argue that censorship can protect unsuspecting viewers from offensive material, others claim that it is a form of censorship and censorship should not be part of a library’s mission. As a result, this is an issue that demands further examination. 

To begin, libraries are often seen as places of refuge and learning. Censorship violates this comforting atmosphere, as it limits the range of materials that people have access to. Censorship restricts the free and open exchange of ideas and dialogue, stifling the development of critical thinking. It also allows libraries or library boards to practice their own personal morality, which could lead to bias in decisions about what materials are or are not acceptable for public libraries.

Furthermore, history has taught us that censorship often leads to suppression of information that may be deemed revolutionary or heretical. The silencing of opposing views in the library only serves to create an environment that promotes a single, accepted opinion, rather than an open discussion of diverse perspectives. 

On the other hand, it could be argued that censorship is important in order to protect viewers – particularly children – from potentially offensive material. This is particularly true in the case of material that is particularly graphically violent, contains explicit sex, or promotes drug abuse. Such materials have no place in libraries, as they may have a damaging effect on those who are exposed to them.
