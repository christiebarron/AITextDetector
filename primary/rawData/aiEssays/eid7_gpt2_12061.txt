An example of a time someone in my life was patient was for one of my sons and he was really looking forward to our son's birthday party. I told him I was afraid about my two sons because my two boys and I had a history of substance abuse. The man wanted to tell me that the men he spoke to was really not that serious. He said, "Well, they were drunk on that night, and they looked like they were not in good spirits."

He gave a quote as the reason he was afraid and was told, "That's it." And there wasn't much to say. The man didn't lie. He took the time to be brave and give his story. It felt good to be able to tell my son that he wasn't doing well. I was pretty sure that would be my message about my children.
