MOSCOW, August 2, 2013 (RIA Novosti) - The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has the audience coming out in tears in the following week. The author, who also writes as 'Lara,' spoke with USA TODAY about the impact the book's title has on her life.


The story of the novel was first published for the Nov. 2003 issue of the National Book Award-winning German publisher Vrije Universiteit Stiftung in London, on Sept. 11, 2001, and was released in paperback and in September 2007 on Vrije.

In it, Lara interviews her husband and ex-boyfriend, the author, about her book and the man she loves and lost in Vietnam.


Speaking to Vrije, the 70-year-old founder of a publishing company described the book as a "real-time memoir". He was asked a question that elicited an immediate response. When a question came through asking Lara if he knew Lenny, she replied "Never. Now she knows me". "This is no different from writing." A moment later the woman asked about her daughter. "It's very funny," Lara replied.
