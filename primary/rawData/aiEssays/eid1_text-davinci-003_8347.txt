I recently had a customer service experience that really demonstrated the power of being patient. My flight had been canceled and I was trying to find a new one, but the customer service line was very long and everyone was quite frustrated as we waited. I found myself getting frustrated and impatient too, until I noticed a woman further down the line who was being incredibly patient, even though she had been waiting longer than anyone else.

Eventually, it was her turn and she spoke calmly and politely with the airline representative, even though it was clear that several things had gone wrong. She smiled and thanked the representative for their help and said goodbye with a kind tone in her voice.

Her simple display of patience was incredibly inspiring. I realized that it was possible to remain understanding and tolerant of a situation even when it was difficult. I took a deep breath and reminded myself that a good attitude would help the situation resolve more quickly and make the experience more pleasant for everyone. I was finally able to get the help I needed and it was in no small part due to the example set by the patient woman in line.
