An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with me on a busy bus from my home town. In her life I always found people very upset when she'd not turned to me as the main train service in town. So over a year later I used me to get on the train for almost 40 km as part of a long journey back through my life to get to work.

My father also taught me the art of being a man in a wheelchair when he was at home but it was still not an acceptable style for me to stand at the end of any bus or rail journey but in the beginning when a woman in a wheelchair walked by, I had to say "hey, can you please stop by to see what I'm doing", and when she did, I said "you look great."

So what does a man need to learn when he is about to walk by like that? One moment I was in one of those 'crisis-prevention' classes where all women were discussing who they were with. A few minutes earlier, I was walking down a narrow street when I was approached by people in my midst. My partner, who was walking up and down a street that I wanted to see some of, yelled "you look great, look great!" I knew her and I got to say hello and she nodded, so I got off of I-80 and left with her. That moment of walking by got me hooked on a part of society
