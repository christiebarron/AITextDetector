One of the hallmarks of a free, open, and vibrant society is access to knowledge and the freedom to choose how each individual wants to access and interact with that knowledge. When it comes to the local library, censoring books, music, movies, and magazines is not only a breach of this freedom, but is ultimately detrimental to our ability to learn and interact with our environment. 

When certain materials are removed — or not allowed — from libraries, members of the community are denied the opportunity to explore and consider perspectives they might not otherwise encounter. This limits our ability to engage in constructive dialogue and gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the world around us. By allowing individuals to be exposed to a broad range of ideas and expressions, libraries help cultivate a culture of open-mindedness and provide an invaluable resource for critical thought and discourse. 

Moreover, censorship in libraries creates a slippery slope where materials can be arbitrarily deemed inappropriate and taken off the shelves. Without a clear understanding of the criteria for censorship, as well as a valid legal foundation and a respected oversight committee, libraries risk becoming a tool for censorship. We must ensure that this does not happen.

In conclusion, censorship in libraries deprives our society of the full benefit of meaningful access to knowledge. This denies us the opportunity to explore ideas and recognize the value of creative speech. Libraries must be preserved as open outlets for free expression and freedom of information.
