Dear Editor,

As technology advances, so does our reliance on computers, tablets and other digital devices. While I believe that technology has many benefits, I have serious concerns about the potential effects of computers on people.

Recent studies have suggested that computers cause a range of physical and mental health issues, including eye strain, headaches, stress, and anxiety. Furthermore, because of our near-constant access to technology, it's easy to become addicted to digital devices, resulting in social isolation and relationship problems. 

We must take steps to control our use of computers and protect ourselves and our families from the negative effects of too much technology. It is important to keep in mind that computers are tools meant to be used and not abused; they are most effective when used in moderation by everyone.

Everyone should be mindful of how often they are using and exposed to technology in order to avoid its potential risks. Parents must set guidelines and restrictions on how and when their children use computers and other devices. Moreover, it's important to take breaks away from our screens and spend quality time with loved ones. 

I believe that computers can provide tremendous convenience, but we must use them responsibly and be aware of the potential risks. 

Sincerely, 
[Name]
