I was recently visiting my grandparents' house when I was surprised to see a dog in their backyard. My grandparents had never owned a pet before, so I was very curious to learn more about the pup. 

I asked my grandmother what the story was and she told me that a neighbor had recently found the abandoned dog and had offered it to my grandparents. I was so glad to hear this, as I adore animals and had always wanted my grandparents to get one. 

My grandmother then told me that the neighbor had mentioned the pup needed some additional training which was why he offered it to my grandparents â€“ they seemed like the perfect candidates! I asked my grandmother if the neighbor had given them a timeline for the pup's training. 

My grandmother smiled and said, "We have all the time in the world for this pup, so there is no timeline for us." I knew right then and there that my grandparents were the perfect people for the job. They were patient and understanding and would give the pup all the love it needs during its training. 

I'm so proud of my grandparents for taking this pup in and I can't wait to see it all grown up, happy, and healthy!
