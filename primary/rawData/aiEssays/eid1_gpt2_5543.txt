Computers have many effects on people. In order to be intelligent and happy, you need some of the things that make us happy: patience.

Languages are more than just words. People get bored of certain things, like writing the same word twice. We also have trouble remembering what the word means. If one person did something useful instead of writing it over and over in her grammar and sentence, she might think that we are illiterate: you couldn't read the correct sentence. So you always have to look at the grammar, which isn't in charge. The problem is, I'm too hard on myself sometimes.

So I had to do something about it. So I developed a project on The Conversation and It's All About You. I'd been working on it for a while, and after some discussions with my best friend, Tim, he had one idea:

Show me other people's favorite movies. In a way, he said, this is what makes us do it. The first thing we would do is make a list of movies we'd like to see: movies such as The Great Gatsby, The Wizard of Oz, The Twilight Zone, The Hobbit and more. We'd have one big list each day, and then each weekend start watching movies, and Lairdovo would be there and we'd keep in touch through Skype every week.

I think that could save us money.

He said he loved to make movies.
