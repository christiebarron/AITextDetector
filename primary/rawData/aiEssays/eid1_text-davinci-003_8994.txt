Dear Editor:

Have you ever noticed how we rely so heavily on computers in our everyday lives? Itâ€™s no wonder the effects of this technology are both positive and negative.

On the one hand, computers have revolutionized the way we work, increased efficiency, and allowed for more accurate decision-making. Without computers, many of the tasks we now take for granted would not be possible.

On the other hand, the over-dependence on computers can actually be detrimental. For example, it can be argued that technology has led to a decrease in interpersonal communication, making it easier to disconnect from loved ones and social situations. Additionally, heavy computer use has been linked to increased health problems including neck and back pain, vision issues, and even carpal tunnel syndrome. 

As technology continues to evolve, it is our responsibility to ensure that our reliance on computers is balanced. Let us not forget the importance of human interaction and the need to unplug from devices every now and then.

For these reasons, I urge readers to think about the potential long-term effects of computers and to proceed with caution.

Sincerely,

[Name]
