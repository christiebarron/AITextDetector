The Empire State Building has seen a lot of history since its construction in 1931, and it is still remembered as one of the most iconic and impressive skyscrapers in the world. A lesser known fact is that the building was originally designed with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock. However, many obstacles had to be overcome for this plan to be realised. 

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was structural guarantee. The mooring mast, which was designed to be the point of contact between the balloon and the tower, needed to be made of strong material, with its base firmly set in the ground and its shaft maintained with extremely high security. Additionally, the mast needed to be tall enough to allow even the largest dirigible in the world to be able to dock. Due to the stringent building regulations in New York City, the mast had to meet strict requirements in terms of its size, structure and security features. 

The second obstacle was ensuring the safety of both the dirigible and the tower. Given that dirigibles are filled with flammable gases, there were concerns that allowing them to dock could pose a fire risk to the Empire State Building. Therefore, safety protocols needed to be in place to ensure that the dirigible would not cause any disruption or structural integrity issues. This meant that the mooring mast and the tower had to be equipped with specially designed safety features that would help
