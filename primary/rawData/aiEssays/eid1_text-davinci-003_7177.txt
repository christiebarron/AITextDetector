In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays an important role in the development of the cyclist's journey. The story takes place on a desolate country road and the cyclist is surrounded by a barren landscape, giving the reader a feeling of isolation and loneliness. The lack of other life forms on the road emphasizes the cyclist's inner vulnerability as he heads further along.

The story also hints at the cyclist's fate with the intensity of the setting. Just as the sunsets and the road stretches out in front of him, the wind rises and he is hit with formidable obstacles such as deep potholes and sharp rocks. These tests force the cyclist to confront his own struggles and fears in order to overcome each obstacle. The experience of overcoming these roadblocks is what makes his journey meaningful in the end.

The weather also plays a part in the cyclist's journey by making it even more difficult. The rain that starts to fall not only heightens the intensity of the setting, but also causes difficulties for the cyclist as he trudges on. He has to fight against the rain and the wind and this symbolizes his inner battle against his own limitations. While he continues in spite of all the obstacles, his journey strengthens his character as he eventually handles the impact of the rough road.

The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" is powerful in providing the cyclist with a unique experience in his journey. It establishes a sense of loneliness and vulnerability
