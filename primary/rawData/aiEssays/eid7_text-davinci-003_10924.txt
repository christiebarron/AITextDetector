I remember not too long ago when my mother got diagnosed with a chronic illness. It felt like a sudden, crippling blow to me and surprisingly, she took it with great poise and resilience. She never seemed to get too overwhelmed with the situation until a few weeks later when things got challenging.

Instead of getting into a state of despair, she was patient and stayed positive. No matter how bad the days got, she always had something nice to say. Every time she got sick, she was comforting and understanding to herself.

What really impressed me was that she was able to put aside her own feelings to focus on my needs. Her illness changed many things in our lives, but she was patient and knew that things would eventually get better.

Although her illness was difficult, she didn't let it define her. Instead, she persevered, stayed strong and kept her chin up. She was patient throughout her journey and showed us that life may throw obstacles our way, but it is always possible to overcome them with patience.
