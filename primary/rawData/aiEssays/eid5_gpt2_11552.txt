The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is an almost overwhelming and utterly heartbreaking picture of the human face in the hands of the American empire's powerful foreign leaders. The book and its creators, the authors of the book, share the spirit of a deep personal struggle and a profound concern for the future of American society. They have a different vision of what life should look like under the Trump administration. A new chapter in their lives is about the importance of the American people.

'From Home is a powerful memoir by a veteran of one of the greatest empires in human history,' said Michael D. Whitehurst, president and cofounder of the National Endowment for Democracy. 'There are a lot of people living and working in the United States, and the current administration is not about them, it's about them. It's about these people who are not yet under a Trump presidency. It's about the American people who will suffer from the consequences if such a man takes over.'
