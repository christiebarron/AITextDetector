The Empire State Building was designed and constructed during the 1930s, a time when airplanes and dirigibles were becoming increasingly commonplace. Docking a dirigible at this iconic New York City landmark presented a unique engineering challenge; due to the strong gusts of wind in the city, it was difficult to moor a dirigible safely and securely. In her article, 'The Mooring Mast,' Marcia Amidon Lüsted details the obstacles the engineers of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to equip the building for airship arrivals.

Perhaps the most significant obstacle that the Empire State Building engineers faced was finding a way to secure the dirigible when landing. In order to ensure a safe arrival, it was necessary to equip the tallest building in the city with a ‘mooring mast’ at the very top where the ships could be tethered. This ‘mast’ was not only taller than the building but also had to be wind-resistant, as it had to withstand the windy conditions of the city. Engineers determined that a steel structure, one hundred feet higher than the building’s roof, had to be built in order to securely attach the dirigibles. 

This steel structure presented a second obstacle to the engineers. In order to ensure the mooring mast was strong and stable enough to protect the airships, it was necessary to anchor the steel structure to the upper floors of the building. This meant having to make
