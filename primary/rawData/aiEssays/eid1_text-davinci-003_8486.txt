I was extremely frustrated with my little brother the other day. He had not been listening to our parents and wound up making a huge mess in the kitchen. I was ready to lose my temper and scold him, but I reminded myself to be patient. 

Rather than getting angry, I sat down and calmly asked my brother why he had done it. It turned out that he was feeling bored and wanted something to do, so I redirected him by suggesting activities to help him stay productive. I could tell that he was grateful that I was so understanding.

In the end, my patience paid off. Not only did he clean up after himself, but he also promised to always listen to what our parents had to say in the future. It felt great to handle the situation so calmly and positively!
