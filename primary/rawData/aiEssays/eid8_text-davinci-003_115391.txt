I will never forget the day that laughter brought my husband and me closer together. It was on the day of our wedding anniversary. We had been married for six years and while we loved each other deeply, we both felt that things had become a little stagnant. We were looking for a way to reignite the spark in our marriage. 

That day, we were out shopping for a gift to mark the occasion. As we walked down the street, I turned to say something to him and began to laugh. It wasn't intentional but I couldn't help myself. He had an expression on his face that was simply too funny not to laugh at. We ended up in a fit of laughter, to the point where I had to hold onto him to keep from falling over. 

It was in that moment that I realized how much laughter had been missing from our relationship. We had become so busy with our everyday lives that we had neglected to share a laugh. We decided then and there that laughter would be a key element in our marriage going forward. 

Since that day, laughter has become an even more important part of our relationship. Whenever one of us starts to feel a bit down or overwhelmed, the other will start telling a joke or acting silly. Suddenly all of our troubles seem to melt away.
