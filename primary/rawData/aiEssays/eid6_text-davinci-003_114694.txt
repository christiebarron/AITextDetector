The prospect of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was no small feat. In the early twentieth century, the technology used to construct such behemoths of steel and masonry had never been tested on such a massive scale before. Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book The Mooring Mast examines the innumerable obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to achieve this ambition.

Engineers and architects alike knew that allowing dirigibles to dock at the 408-foot skyscraper would be a challenge. The problematic issues they faced included finding a way to safely support the weight of the giant airships, creating a long enough dock for such an enormous structure, and providing a solid platform for the citizens of New York City to travel, watch, and otherwise observe the dirigibles land. These difficulties were compounded by the two main types of dirigibles operating at the time, the Zeppelin, a huge gas-filled airship, and the “blimp,” which was powered by an internal combustion engine. Docking these two types of dirigibles posed unique challenges due to their size and weight.

The design team considered various ideas for the dock. Using a crane to support the airships was quickly ruled out as impractical due to the sheer size of the dirigibles. A mooring mast towered 1,000 feet above the spire’s roofline was another proposed solution, though the fragility of
