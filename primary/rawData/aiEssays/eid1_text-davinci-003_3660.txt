Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter in order to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion, computers have had a positive effect on people's lives. 

In this day and age, computers are essential for people to live comfortably, and they have made many aspects of our lives easier. One of the most important advantages of computers is that they have greatly streamlined the learning process. With the aid of computers, we can access a plethora of knowledge and resources that have improved our education. Furthermore, computers can also serve as a tool for communication. It is now easier than ever to communicate with people from around the globe, and this has contributed to a more connected global community.

Another benefit of computers is that they have facilitated automation and other advances in the field of technology. By relying on computers, much of the work that used to be done manually can now be automated, allowing people to save time and energy. This has also allowed businesses to become faster and more efficient, leading to larger profits.

At the end of the day, while computers can be dangerous in the wrong hands, the overall impact on people's lives has been positive. By providing numerous new resources and opportunities, computers have revolutionized our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
