The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The decision came after a government minister accused of being a "mafia" for blocking development of the first half of last century.

In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that developers with public-housing projects cannot build dirigibles unless they pay a royalty-rate of Rs500-Rs800 per square metre for the necessary equipment.

While the ruling left many construction groups unable to meet some demand, the company was accused of obstructing the process of building dirigibles.

"The government has made this decision because of the power vested in the courts. This is a serious matter for us, the public safety of Dharamsala.

"It is the responsibility of the government to put the industry back to the pre-historic stage through the legal process."

In 2009, the government of BSP, under the Centre's intervention, allowed a third Dharamsala-based dirigical development company, Sustained Development Corporation, to construct a 3,000-metre high vertical tower for the National Railway Building (NWR).

The building project was deemed environmentally sensitive even though the construction area was only 1.5 hectare.

But when the government took over the company's land, Sustained Corporation was forced to cut back production, and by December 2011, the maximum production was reduced to around 60 dirigicals
