When I was younger, I used to get quite frustrated with my younger brother when he got sloppy while doing chores around the house. He would always leave a mess to be cleaned up, no matter the task. I would often get angry at him or try to do it all alone, only to be frustrated with him even more.

One day, however, I decided to practice patience and see what happens. I took a deep breath, counted to three, and calmly asked him to help clean up the mess he had made. To my surprise, he cooperated without a single complaint and even asked if there was anything else he could help me with.

It was a huge breakthrough. By being patient and trying to work with my brother like an adult, it made the chore so much easier. From then on, I realised the importance of being patient with him and it had a positive impact on our relationship.
