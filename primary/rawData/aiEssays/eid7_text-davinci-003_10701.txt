I was waiting in line at the grocery store, like usual. As I was slowly moving through the line, I noticed that the person in front of me had a lot of items and was taking a bit longer to check out. I could feel myself starting to get frustrated and impatient, but then I remembered something my mom always told me: be patient, everyone is doing their best. So I took a deep breath and smiled, reminding myself that I had all the time in the world.

The cashier was having a bit of trouble scanning some of the things the person in front of me had bought, and there were moments I wanted to suggest they might try a different method. But I just waited patiently, and eventually the cashier was able to find a way to correctly scan the items.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the customer in front of me was finished checking out and it was my turn. I was grateful for the reminder about patience, because it allowed me to get through that situation with a smile on my face and a calm demeanor. It felt so much better than if I had let my frustration take over and been impatient.
