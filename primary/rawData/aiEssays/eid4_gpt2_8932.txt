The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the most crucial element of this book, which is just the beginning, is the first line. And that first line is simply the beginning of her line. And when we finally get to that line, when we get to her relationship with her father, she's actually the first in line to get laid. And she's the first to become a father once she gets married; right from the first page up. Or she's getting married. And she's the first to really get that relationship into place; she's the perfect father. You know, how is this even a possibility given there is no reason she can do this?

AVC: One would imagine she would say no. I think this might cause so many people to come with a fear that maybe they don't want to marry one of their own.

DR: No, I mean, that's pretty crazy, isn't it? People assume that their own marriage wouldn't hurt someone that badly, and they don't realize how wrong this is because they're in a marriage. That's how I do it. Right? So I've never even done that.

I like to think what you're saying is kind of true. It's not just the fact that this is an example of what you're talking about, but there's an example of how you can make that clear by saying, "Well let me know what you think of this."
