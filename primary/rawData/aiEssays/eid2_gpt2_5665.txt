I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, public information centers and the like will become an important tool for learning, as well as helping solve an important societal change in education."

"We see the opportunity for educators working with children, students and communities across all backgrounds, and also on all ages, to share our opinions and experiences, and to share perspectives that will promote change and build a better future through our common values and values of kindness, justice and generosity Ilysa

It is an important tool for educators. They play a key role in learning, and are a critical asset to educating, connecting and building strong friendships.

But at the same time, children need a secure place to go to learn, to share opinions and ideas, and to support one another. And it is critical that our schools and libraries are a primary means of providing safe, nurturing environments for children on all walks of life, based not only on science, but on the individual spirit and work ethic of all individuals.

This is the reason it is important that children learn to be confident: for the rest of us, it is a duty. It is also a responsibility and a duty that we all share, as adults, all the time and we should all be proud of the strength and resilience students and adults carry.
