The Empire State Building is an iconic American structure and icon of art deco architecture that has come to symbolize New York City. It is famous for many reasons, including its observation decks, its stunning views of Manhattan, and for its famous dirigible docks. The feat of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building and the obstacles that the builders overcame to make that possible are detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast.”

In the mid-1920s, four teams of engineers, architects, and technologists sought to make the dream of docked dirigibles at the Empire State Building a reality. The most pressing challenge was avoiding the shockwaves that result from the movement of the airship’s objecting creating turbulence in the immediate area. In order to achieve that, the engineers designed a system of overlapping sheaths of open steel mesh held together by tension rods, which together made up the mooring mast. This was placed on the 69th and 70th floors of the building, and extended more than 400 feet above the street.

The team also had to consider the engineering of the tension rods, which needed to be precise enough to be able to withstand the turbulent air currents created by the airship and the building’s own motions. The rods were the only element of the mooring mast that had to be stronger than normal-grade steel, and they had
