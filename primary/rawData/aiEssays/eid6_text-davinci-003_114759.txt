Despite its iconic status, the building was almost equipped with an unique feature: a docking station for dirigibles, also known as airships. This proposal, however, encountered several obstacles during the construction of the building, as chronicled in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast”.

The first obstacle the architects of the Empire State Building faced in their effort to allow dirigibles to dock was the building design itself. The structure was not tall enough to accommodate a tower for the docking mast, as it would have interfered with the surrounding skyline. In addition, no room was left to construct decks or landing pads that could be easily accessed. As a result, the plans to incorporate a mooring mast had to be abandoned.

The second obstacle was public opinion. At the time, the notion of airships docking in the city was unprecedented. Such an idea was met with some suspicion by the public, especially those living in the city. People feared that the presence of dirigibles could cause air traffic issues and even property damage if an accident were to occur. These concerns caused the majority of citizens to oppose the mooring mast, thus sabotaging the efforts to bring dockable airships to the Empire State Building.

The third obstacle was the cost. The plan to build a moor
