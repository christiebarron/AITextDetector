I was recently on a road trip to visit family and I ran into some pretty bad traffic. To make matters worse, my GPS was not updated and the roads were being reworked. I felt so frustrated and it seemed like the traffic was never going to clear up. Despite my annoyance, I knew being patient was the best way to handle the situation.

So, I took a few deep breaths and just stayed calm. I kept my eyes on the road and tried to remain positive. Eventually, the traffic cleared up and I was able to continue on my journey. I was so relieved and felt a bit embarrassed for how aggravated I had been a few moments before.

I am proud of myself for staying patient throughout the whole ordeal. Every once in a while, we have to remind ourselves that being patient is the best way to handle difficulties.
