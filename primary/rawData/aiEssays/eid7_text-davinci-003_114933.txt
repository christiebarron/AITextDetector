I recently had to juggle managing a large project with overseeing the day-to-day operations of my team at work. As the deadline approached, I started to get overwhelmed by the amount of work that needed to be done. Despite the building pressure, I took a few deep breaths and remained calm. I reminded myself to be patient, and that everything would get done in time. Instead of feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, I chose to focus my energy on breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. I also called up my team members one by one and encouraged them to stay positive and motivated while explaining the importance of everyoneâ€™s contribution.

At the end of the day, we met the deadline and everything had gone according to plan. I felt a lot of relief, but more importantly, I was proud of myself for staying calm in the face of such a challenging situation. I had managed to remain patient and be a source of motivation for my team, and that was worth much more to me than a successful outcome.
