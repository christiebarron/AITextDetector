I remember being a nervous college freshman, meeting all of my suitemates for the first time. I had no idea what to expect, and my stomach turned flips as they one-by-one introduced themselves to me.

We didn't have any shared interests and I felt awkward and unsure of myself. I didn't have much to contribute to the conversation, so I just quietly listened.

Then, all of sudden, one of my suitemates said something that struck me as so hilarious that I couldn't help but burst out into uncontrollable laughter. My laughter caught the attention of the group, and I felt my cheeks flush with embarrassment.

To my surprise, my suitemates began to join in with their own infectious laughter. Before I knew it, we were all chuckling at what had happened, creating an undeniable bond between us.

We laughed until there were tears rolling down our faces, creating a strong feeling of camaraderie among us. We made jokes and told stories that kept us laughing for hours that night and many others in the future.

To this day, I still cherish that first night of laughter as a moment that truly changed the course of our friendship. Laughter has since been an integral part of our relationship, and I'm so grateful to have found such amazing friends.
