The building of the Empire State Building was an engineering marvel, in part due to its design to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. However, the builders of this structure faced numerous obstacles in ensuring this grand feat of engineering was achieved. The first of these obstacles was the fact that the building ran the risk of being too tall for the mooring mast it would need to incorporate for the dirigibles to dock safely. Such a mast would need to be at least 100-feet tall and, if it did not reach high enough, the airships would not be able to moor safely. 

The engineers also had to determine which material to use for the mast. It would need to be light enough to make it possible for the mast itself to be lifted into place without risking its own stability, especially as it would be at the top of the finished building. They also had to take into consideration the effects of wind on the structureâ€™s ability to support the weight of a docked airship. 

In addition to the technical engineering concerns, there were also safety regulations that needed to be met. In particular, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the mooring mast be located at least 500 feet clear of the building and have its own dedicated quay. Furthermore, the building had to be provided with a generator-powered mooring light, along with a bell system to signal the presence of a docked airship.
