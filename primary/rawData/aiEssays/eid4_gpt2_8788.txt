The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because "the spirit has not died out for so long" when the book is read. But here, by using a lot of things I didn't use, it became quite difficult to keep up. This, by the way, is a work I have been wanting to review since 2010. I hope to have my best one yet!
