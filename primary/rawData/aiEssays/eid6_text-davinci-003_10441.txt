The dream of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was a monumental task to accomplish. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building due to the height of the building, the engineering feat required to achieve such a lofty goal, and environmental complications. 

Building the Empire State Building to support a dirigible's docking station was incredibly difficult as the Empire State Building towers to a height of 1,454 feet and weighs more than 365,000 tons. To accommodate a full size dirigible, engineers skilfully designed the building to withstand the additional 10 million pounds of weight. The building was built using large steel beams and pillars placed strategically throughout the building to support the extra weight. 

The sheer engineering complexity of a docking tower to support the weight of the docking dirigible was an obstacle that needed to be overcome. The design had to incorporate a rigid structure that could extend beyond the height of the Empire State Building itself. To reduce the amount of weight put on the building, the mast had to be extremely lightweight yet strong enough to withstand the force of a landing dirigible. After extensive testing on different types of materials, aluminum was chosen as it provided the ideal combination of strength and weight.

In addition to being a feat of engineering, potential environmental complications presented a large obstacle. Due to the strong air currents in New York City, the dirigibles' landings would need to
