To some, the idea that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if found to be offensive is anathema. To them, the right to access information should supersede all other considerations. To others, the idea of allowing such content to be freely available seems downright immoral.

I believe that libraries should not censor the materials that they offer.

Libraries have a great opportunity to act as an educational source â€“ providing guidance on what is appropriate for different people and age groups. Through use of annotated bibliographies, librarians can identify potentially controversial topics or materials and provide readers with a clear description of the contents of a work so they can make informed decisions.

In conclusion, censorship should not be used as a tool in the library setting. Rather, librarians should provide readers with the education and tools they need to make informed decisions about what materials are suitable for them. Libraries should celebrate freedom of
