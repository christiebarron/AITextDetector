The public library is a beacon of knowledge and a safe haven for readers. It stands to reason that access to books, movies, music and magazines should remain unfettered and available for all to explore. To censor books, movies, music and magazines is to take away certain liberties and impede on one's ability to make their own decisions and form their own opinions.

It is understandable when towns and cities place restrictions on access to certain publications that may contain explicit or adult only content. However, censorship of any kind significantly limits the amount of information that readers have access to about the world around them. For example, without the ability to check out books on controversial topics, like religion and politics, readers are deprived of an opportunity to learn more and form educated opinions. Additionally, censoring materials hinders creativity and expression and can lead to a dearth of film and music offerings in library collections. 

The library should be seen as a library of last resort, providing access to books and materials to those in need of them that don’t have other avenues or resources to gain access to them. Censorship of any kind stands in stark contrast to this mission and to the library’s duty of fostering education. 

Though certain forms of censorship may be necessary to preserve order and societal norms, censorship of books, movies, music and magazines in the library goes too far. Censorship removes an opportunity for curious readers, learners and lovers of literature,
