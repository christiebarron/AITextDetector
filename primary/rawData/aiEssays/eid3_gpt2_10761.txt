Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is a relatively minor variable which results in a slight increase in tyre wear and a slightly less significant increase in the risk of being in a crash later on. This is not an easy variable to tweak, but it should, and most cyclists are aware of it.

In the 'roughroad' category, however, the effect for any given cyclist on an individual road is to increase in wear and the amount of tyre wear. The overall result for an individual road is an increase in tyre wear of about 0.4 to 0.6 times larger which is an increase in risk of a collision. In the most common situations, road wear at any given speed will decrease by about 0.3 to 0.7 times.

There can be no doubt that the range of road-holding devices used is significant. They are:

Suspension and head,

Carbon tread and carbon wheels,

Dry brake,

Dirty exhaust and tyres.

You can find all the important details of how these different road-holding devices work in more detail on the Roading and Road Safety page.

An important factor which makes road tyres unique is that they also use large numbers of tyres of different shapes based on their shape. This is very important to understand and for many reasons. For example, when trying to tell the difference from road and pavement tyres
