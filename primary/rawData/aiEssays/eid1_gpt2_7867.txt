Computers have many effects on people. It's not uncommon to find people with low expectations and lower skill levels. There are people who are in debt, who are struggling financially to pay bills, and who aren't sure when it will make them feel better about not living their lives. It can make life difficult for them, and they probably don't expect it to just be a relief from everyday life. As a result, their best option is to work towards being better off instead of spending the resources available to them.

That's a lot of words; but this can be done, at least with some patience. A good example of the benefit we can potentially provide with the time we dedicate to this endeavor could be for people with low expectations and working on a career path that can allow them to give some of their money back to an organization that cares for them.
