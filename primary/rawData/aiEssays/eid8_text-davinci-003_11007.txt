I was on a long drive with my best friend; the windows were down and the musical notes of nature were in tune with the silence between us. We had been friends for years, yet had since grown apart. 

After an hour or so of meandering, we decided to pull off the highway and take a break. We were supposed to be going somewhere, but I no longer remembered where. As we stepped out of the car and felt the cool afternoon breeze, something felt like it shook the ground beneath us. 

I looked over at my best friend and noticed that his face was turning bright red. We couldn't help but burst into hysterical laughter - he had silently released a huge fart, and the wind had instantly spread its scent! We laughed longer than either of us had in a while. 

It was in this moment that I realized how much I'd missed the connection we used to have. That moment of laughter brought us closer together than anything else ever had. We sat there, laughing until our stomachs hurt and the scent slowly faded away. 

It was a moment that would never be forgotten.
