I believe that censorship of materials in libraries constitutes violation of due process and is prohibited pursuant to Section 922 of the Administrative Procedure Act, as amended. However, a person must show that the materials are necessary to facilitate public understanding of any matter that could be discussed or addressed by another person in arming and disciplining him or her.

3. There has been no incident where the person involved in producution of the material has been convicted of a criminal offense. However, notice of this offence and of any subsequent charges shall be available on the Public Records Section to persons not in possession of copies.

4. Prior to the commission of a crime of omission, the person shall not be criminally responsible for the material he or she produces, in whole or in part, except by reasonable efforts of the prosecution. No sentence will be provided for failure to publish the material without written or oral order.
