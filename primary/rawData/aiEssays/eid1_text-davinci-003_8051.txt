The building of the Empire State Building presented many obstacles to architects and engineers, especially in regards to allowing dirigibles to dock at the highest towers of the building. Dirigibles, or airships, posed a unique challenge due to their fragile and complex nature, as well as the need for fireproofing, since tethering them at the top of the building was no easy task. Because of these hurdles, the construction of a sturdy, safe mooring mast was critical for safely docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building. 

The process of building a mooring mast to dock a dirigible was a difficult and costly task. Creating a stable structure that could remain strong against gusting winds and turbulence was a major engineering accomplishment. In addition, the mooring mast had to be fireproofed to ensure the safety of the passengers in the event of a fire. Furthermore, the design of the mast had to ensure proper guidance of the airships into the mooring mast allowing them to be securely tethered. 

A major obstacle was the mooring mast's engineering design. Finding the right mast design that enabled the airships to lock into place safely was a difficult challenge and required intricate calculations of airship trajectory and wind conditions. The mast had to be wide enough to prevent turbulence from toppling an airship into the building and strong enough to withstand the gusting winds of New York City. As well, it had to work with
