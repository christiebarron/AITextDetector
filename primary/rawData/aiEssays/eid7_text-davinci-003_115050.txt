I remember last summer, when I was responsible for organizing an outdoor family picnic. I had been planning the details of the picnic for the past two weeks and was excited for the day to finally arrive. On the day before the picnic, it started to rain. I felt my heart sink, because all of my planning was at risk of being ruined. Everyone in my family was pretty disappointed, but they all kept their cool.

I was particularly impressed with my dad, who remained patient as he would always do. He suggested that we stick to the plan, unless the rain didn't let up the next day. He even called the weather station to see if there was any hope of the rain stopping. Unfortunately, it only drizzled the next day and it became apparent that our picnic was off. 

But once again, my dad was patient and understanding. He got us all back into the car and drove us to a nearby restaurant. He said that the restaurant had a great patio that we can enjoy together. We ended up having a wonderful time; it was a great experience that I'll always remember! My dad's patience and understanding was incredible; it made a big difference to our family that day, and I'm glad that I was there to see it.
