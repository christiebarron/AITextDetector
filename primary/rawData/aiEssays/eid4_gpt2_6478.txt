The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because in doing so it becomes the central, and also the most important chapter, of its characterisation. Its climax feels a little bit rushed at times, but the final action of Winter Hibiscus and all its various adventures are all fairly well done. If you want to see what the book contains you should follow the other chapters rather than going down to the first, since there is too much for just about every character and all of them do their thing out of nowhere. 
The story actually begins with the story of the main character, Hōji. In the book this makes pretty much all of the main characters and their adventures come to an end (or at least it eventually does), so at such a good time, Hōji is forced into taking off his hat and putting on a costume because of an accident, and for some reason, the story is only half complete. There are many things to watch out for in those kind of events. The main character of Winter Hibiscus is not seen as a big name, as he is considered too weak to become an action character, but is merely some type of young woman as we see her. On the surface she looks like a typical college girl from a fairly normal background because she doesn't seem to fit the expected personality or her name. When you turn away from the typical class person of Winter Hibiscus you will quickly realize what the main cast of characters are
