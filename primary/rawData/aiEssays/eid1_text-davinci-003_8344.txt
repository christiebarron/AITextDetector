It was just another typical work day and I had to handle a large number of customer service requests. It was only 10am and already I was swamped. One customer in particular was very difficult. He just wasn't getting what I was trying to explain. After a few minutes, I felt my patience slipping away, and I took a few deep breaths to try and calm myself down. I reminded myself that this customer was probably frustrated and just needed a patient and understanding person to help him.

I kept my cool and tried to explain the process in a different way. I could tell my patience was paying off because the customer started to understand. I was eventually able to help him with his issue and felt relieved that I hadn't lost my cool in the face of his frustrations. It felt good knowing I had risen to the challenge and been patient with him. It's situations like these that make me proud of the work I do.
