I was sitting with my best friend in a coffee shop, a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the street outside. We'd been chatting for a few minutes when suddenly, I felt a mischievous twinkle in my eye. My friend must have seen it too, because she cocked an eyebrow in my direction, daring me to go for it. So I did.

"I heard an elephant joke the other day, wanna hear it?"

"Oh, I don't know," she playfully tried to hedge, but I knew she really wanted to hear it.

"OK, but you have to promise to laugh," I said.

"I promise," she said with a smile.

"What did the elephant say to the naked man?"

Now she was getting curious.

"I don't know," she said.

"It's 'How do you breathe through that tiny thing?'"

We both erupted into fits of laughter, drawing the attention of the other patrons in the coffee shop. We both looked at each other, still in stiches, and shook our heads in disbelief that such a silly joke had us doubled over in laughter. 

It was in that moment that I realized the power of laughter and shared silliness. Not only did it bring us closer in that moment, it reminded me of why I was so lucky to have her as a friend.
