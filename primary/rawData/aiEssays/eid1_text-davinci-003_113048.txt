Dear Editor, 

I am writing to draw your attention to the effects that computers are having on people, and to urge your readers to consider the potential pitfalls of relying too heavily on this technology.

While computers can perform complex tasks, increase efficiency, and dramatically reduce errors, it is important to be aware of their negative impacts as well. As computers have become increasingly intertwined with our lives, people have grown increasingly reliant on them for even the simplest of tasks. As a result, we are becoming distracted and losing the ability to think critically and make informed decisions on our own.

It is clear that computers have dramatically changed the way our society works and interacts, and this has caused us to significantly reduce our reliance on problem-solving and immediately look to the computer for the answer. This has effectively caused us to become less imaginative and adaptive, becoming dependent on the computerâ€™s assessment of the situation instead of our own.

Moreover, the constant access to technology has caused us to become desensitized to the importance of face-to-face communication. Not only does this undermine our ability to collaborate effectively, but it can also cause us to lose empathy.

In conclusion, I believe that if we are to continue benefiting from computer technology, we must remain mindful of how it can impact us. We must maintain our skills of problem-solving and critical thinking, and prioritize face-to-face communication.

I hope your readers will
