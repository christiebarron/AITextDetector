In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist rides on a long, winding mountain road deep in the French Pyrenees. From the outset, the cyclist is presented with challenging landscape features and conditions that are sure to test him.

The winding mountain road presents the cyclist with numerous curves of varying difficulty. The extreme elevation changes combined with sharp turns require the cyclist to choose an appropriate approach which, if miscalculated, could result in the cyclist losing control or crashing. 

The road and environment is also exceedingly hazardous. In addition to the demanding terrain, the cyclist is presented with numerous obstacles and challenges such as landslides, sharp rocks, and even water crossings.

This combined with the stark beauty of the environment can become draining. The extreme nature of the ride therefore challenges the cyclist in both a physical and mental capacity.
