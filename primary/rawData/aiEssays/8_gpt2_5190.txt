One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 13. When I went to the hospital to find out where my dad had been, I was still scared to come forward. I still think it dangerous. What could a 14-year old do in those circumstances to commit to a sexual act and then go on to commit suicide and lose all sense of self?

At first I thought it was just the internet. I guess if they had more of a say about these matters, maybe they'd be less afraid of us, actually. So I've thought about whether or not to ask her about it. I've had conversations with her, and she's been open with me about these things, and obviously with someone. It was really, really fun. I'm just hoping that there's something that she can offer her support and have it be a safe space where I can have this experience and be in a place where I can do everything I can to help out this girl.
