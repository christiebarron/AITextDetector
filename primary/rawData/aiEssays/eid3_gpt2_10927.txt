Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Here are some examples to help you get started. As an example, use this setting to get an idea of a bike course on a rough road that requires good training. A high quality gravel bike course is much better than some dirt roads. There are always more opportunities for riders to use gravel to get around though.

As you can see, on my first attempt at a road course, I ended up having a rough starting position with a lot of small wheels in the first 20% of the section. But on the second trip, only about half of the gravel turned that way because my bike was too weak to get off-trail and the first 20% of this section started quite quickly, as it had never had ridden past 100ft.

Another problem is where the gravel starts getting worn out. The gravel on this rough road is not well maintained at all times. I ended up with about 3-4 broken gears and no real traction for the next 5 miles, so I ended up finishing off with only 3 hours left on the road.

I have to admit a bunch of the gravel started getting worn out. There are no specific bike wheels or pedals to avoid, and with such a narrow course, you still have a lot of problems, but when I tried a bike that did have wheels and pedals which I probably should have learnt to use as the gravel is so much harder
