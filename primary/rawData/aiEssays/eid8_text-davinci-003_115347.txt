I was walking to the grocery store one afternoon when I decided to take a shortcut through a park. I wasn’t paying attention to where I was going when suddenly I tripped over a branch that was lying in the pathway and landed flat on my face in the dirt.

I was a bit embarrassed, but I couldn’t help but laugh at myself.

That’s when I heard another person laughing as well, and I turned to see an elderly woman grinning at me. She waved her walking stick in the air and said, “Oh, if you can laugh at yourself you’re going to make it in this world!”

We both laughed and talked about life for a bit then she gave me a hug and said, “You’ve made my day! Thank you!”

We parted ways then, and I was still smiling when I walked the rest of the way to the grocery store. That moment reminded me how much laughter can bring two people together and make a connection.
