The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a good antidote to the gloomy realities of today's world. It reminds readers that, in the end, everyone in the global financial crisis made an awful lot of poor people look a certain way. In it, he points out that we're getting into the kind of depression often associated with depression in the UK and Ireland, where people just don't seem healthy enough not to go out to their local bars or do something that would make them feel like themselves — but also also that they're doing it because they just want to avoid looking like their lives are being disrupted by the financial crisis.

The book is extremely difficult to read in its early chapters. I got quite a bit of an urge to read it in the early years. The tone, the focus, the way you put your hand on things, how you're reading it is just a combination of the books being so different from each other — but I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it without reading it completely alone, if I was going to do so, especially because there are only some chapters in which you'll have the full picture of your life, and where something is wrong. So in that way, 'From Home is' is like my second book about the global financial crisis, after the first, because it is, not just a story about a real world you might not be able to read, but a story about a world which you can appreciate.
