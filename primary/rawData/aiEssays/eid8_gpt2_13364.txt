One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my kids were younger and they were playing in my house so I started a joke to them but my daughter said they were just laughing at me. So I said the good thing is they are laughing now but my two best friends are gone. So I say you're too weak then tell them and tell them that you're sorry that you got punched in the face. I say please stay put. Also, you're not going to be in a bar but if you'd like to come and you can talk to somebody (they're there just hanging around like you mentioned) then you could go to the local gym, or one of the bars nearby, or some other place and try what I'd like. I will be trying so I won't hesitate to tell you if I were to try anything it wouldn't be the right thing for one of you. Also, I'm gonna make one of you a good friend and keep it going forever too. Also, I didn't have any issues to Thailand, so don't worry about my face though. I'll get ready to go home soon.
