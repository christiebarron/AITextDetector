Rodriguez reveals vivid details of his childhood that capture both the joys and pains of growing up. He paints a vivid picture of the colorful and vibrant yet often overlooked Latino culture of the time, from the sounds of Spanish and English intermingling, to the bright storefronts and street markets to the vibrant personality of the neighborhood.
