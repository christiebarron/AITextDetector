The creation of the Empire State Building in 1931 was an enormous accomplishment that forever changed the New York City skyline. However, the building was also designed to serve a purely practical purpose: that of welcoming dirigibles for aerial transportation. In order to make this possible, the architects of the building had to overcome a number of obstacles.

The first obstacle was the simple size of the building. With a 102 story structure, the Empire State Building is an impressive structure, and its vast height made it difficult to design a practicable system to bring in the dirigibles. In order to solve this problem, the builders of the building designed a sophisticated system of mooring masts and winches. The mooring mast was an enormous metal tower that was secured to the roof of the building. This tower was equipped with an array of pulleys and winches which could be used to lower the dirigible to the roof and to tie it in place. 

The second obstacle was the sheer strength of the wind currents at the building's altitude. In order for the dirigible to be brought safely to the roof of the building, the architects had to combat the wind. To do so, they designed a network of metal poles, cables, and guy wires around the mast. These would give the dirigible additional stability to withstand the wind and keep it from blowing away. 

The third obstacle the architects of the building faced was the difficulty of loading and unloading passengers
