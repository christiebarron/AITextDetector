The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has the reader hooked. So it should be very satisfying to have a chapter with a very basic idea of what this world is going to be like, and then some. Also, to the readers who may feel the need to read it before. It will teach you many lessons from your favorite comics.
