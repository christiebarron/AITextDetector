I was sitting at a cafe with a good friend of mine, catching up on old times. We talked about our lives, our families, our jobs, but mostly shared funny stories about the crazy things that we had encountered during our travels. Time flew by as we talked and laughed over our stories, and before I knew it, two hours had passed. 

At one point, we were discussing a particularly funny story that I had just related to him, and I started chuckling quite uncontrollably. This set him off too, and soon both of us were in fits of laughter, our faces turning redder and redder as the laughter grew in intensity. The people around us were clearly amused by our antics, some of them even laughing along with us.

Finally, after the laughter died down a bit, I looked over at him and said, "That felt really good. Laughing with you is always the highlight of my day". He smiled back and replied, "It's true, laughter really is the shortest distance between two people." We laughed and enjoyed the moment together, grateful for the love and friendship that we had.
