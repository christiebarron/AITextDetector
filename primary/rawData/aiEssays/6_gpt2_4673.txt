After the opening (1943), it was possible that the dome would remain in place for a year of protection. But by then, the dome had collapsed.

This plan was abandoned by the owners when the design was put forward on the following day. In the meantime, domes having been removed from the hangar in 1943, that of F-8 Eagle, was placed on the first floor of the Imperial Park as part of the plan. These domes are now on the fifth floor of the Imperial Park.On 30 October, 1943, the new and installed Empire State Building was put in a hangar to replace it. This hangar was the only one with a closed elevator or other feature in place, and for the entire day it was inspected and then upgraded, and to include the door system that was in place for some time. In addition to this, a new dome was placed on the first floor of Empire State Building that, if fully installed in time, would make it capable of opening any room inside the building and allowing a flight of some 150 passengers. This is the last entry by any passenger that took the elevator
