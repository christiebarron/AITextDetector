In today’s world of technology and free thought, many now believe that censorship in libraries is a thing of the past. However, censorship in libraries has taken on a new life and form as many parents and even library personnel call for the restrictions of certain types of materials in local libraries. This call for censorship may have some practical applications, but generally speaking it is a step backwards in our society and should not be supported.

When it comes to limiting access to certain types of media in libraries, there are several issues to consider. The first concerns freedom of information and expression, two of our most cherished liberties. The notion that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be kept off of library shelves is a direct violation of these rights. Libraries are the public face of learning, research, and entertainment; the idea that information of any kind should be withheld from library patrons is a direct affront to democracy and equality.

Another issue to consider is that of the library patron’s own responsibility to use these materials for their intended purpose. All materials in libraries should be used in a responsible and respectful manner, and it is not the library’s role to dictate what a patron is allowed to pursue. Furthermore, standard library policies regarding the appropriate use of materials are more than sufficient to protect against any malicious use of material deemed offensive.

Censorship in libraries has no place in society. Libraries should serve as an unrestricted space
