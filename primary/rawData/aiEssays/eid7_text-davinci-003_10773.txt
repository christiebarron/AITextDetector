I was at the grocery store. There were a lot of people and all the checkout lines were really long. Even though I was running late, I decided to wait in one of the lines instead of leaving to go somewhere else. The line moved slowly and it felt like forever before I even got to the cashier.

The cashier seemed to be having a bit of a hard time. She was asking the customer in front of me to double check all of their items and to double check the pricings. I could tell the person was getting very frustrated, but I decided to wait with patience.

Eventually, the items were all checked and paid for. Now it was my turn. I handed the cashier all my items and she went to work. It took a while for the machine to scan all the barcodes, but I remained patient.

As the cashier was counting my change, I saw a woman approaching us. She obviously wanted to check out, but there were no more empty slots for her bags. She looked really angry, but I just smiled at her and asked her to wait in line. She was this close to snapping at me but I decided to remain calm. 

Finally, when everything was sorted and packed, I paid the cashier, thanked her, and left. Although I was running late, I knew that it was much more important to be understanding and patient.
