I remember when I first met Jack. We were at a party in a friend’s house and we clicked almost immediately. We would stand around in the kitchen, trading stories and cracking jokes. Every time one of us said something funny, we’d both burst out laughing uncontrollably, like we hadn’t seen anything as funny as the other in ages. 

As the night went on, our conversations seemed to get more ridiculous and the laughter more frequent. Before we knew it, we were both in tears. So much so that our friend had to join in, just to avoid getting us into trouble. 

At the end of the night, when everyone was packing up their things, Jack leaned in and said “You know, I think I’m really going to like you!” I couldn’t help but laugh, and we both knew that our friendship was going to be an amazing one. 

That night I realized that laughter can truly bond two people together. Now, nearly five years later, Jack and I can still look back and laugh at that one night with great fondness.
