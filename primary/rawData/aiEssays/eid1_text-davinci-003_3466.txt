 

Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. Itâ€™s clear that computers have completely revolutionized the way we go about our day-to-day lives. 

For starters, computers enable us to access a vast array of information quickly and easily. We are able to accomplish tasks in seconds that used to take much longer by hand. From using a search engine to find answers to complex questions to connecting with other people via a variety of platforms, computers have made life infinitely easier. 

Moreover, computers have improved communication and connection in ways unthinkable just a few years ago. We have instant access to the latest news, entertainment, and sporting events. We are also able to use computer networks to collaborate on projects with colleagues halfway around the world. 

Ultimately, while computers have their drawbacks, including exposing us to cybercrimes and reducing face-to-face social interaction, the benefits far outweigh the risks. Computers have made our lives easier and made us more connected than ever before. I therefore strongly believe that people can only benefit from embracing the technology that computers offer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely
