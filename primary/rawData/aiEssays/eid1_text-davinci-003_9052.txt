Dear Editor:

In todayâ€™s technological age, computers have become a pervasive part of our everyday lives. While computers have certainly helped us in countless ways, their presence has been linked to a cause for concern.

Recent research has found that overuse of computers can have serious physical and mental health effects, including neck and shoulder pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, depression, anxiety, and addiction. With the prevalence of computers, more and more of us are spending much of our day at a desk, leading to extended periods of sitting, which can also have negative health consequences.

The convenience of computers and the internet provides many fantastic opportunities for improved communication and collaboration, but it is important that we are aware of the need to take regular breaks from our devices. By setting time limits and taking routine breaks away from computers, we can avoid negative health effects and stay more active both physically and mentally.

Therefore, I urge you to consider the potential health effects computers may have, and to be aware of the need to take regular breaks away from the screen, in order to stay healthy and well. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
