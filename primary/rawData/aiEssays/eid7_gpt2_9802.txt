An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my friend Jim.

I knew Jim personally. He was at the hospital and had already passed away from brain cancer at the end of June of 2010 in Atlanta. The only way to communicate or have a conversation was through text messages and emails. As I was dying he was so good he would sometimes use me as a friend. When I first started in my career with the Knicks I used to text to get the team to open a practice. That just lasted a week or two. So I knew Jim was trying to get the team ready.

We've seen all this. Over the years we've used our skills and knowledge to win games. He's done a lot of the things that he calls "sick" that he has never lost his touch. However, he's a great one.

The Knicks' first season in New York City was a perfect one for him. The fans, coaches and players loved my work. I made a lot of big plays. I helped lead the team the following regular season that was successful when we went to MSG and were able to win. But Jim was as good as when he came to Cleveland. I've known him and been around him. He's just a great guy who is incredibly proud of me for the great things I've achieved there.
