The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After the collapse of the U.S. Postal Service in 1946, a company called I.M.P.'s and a dozen other corporations purchased I.M.P.'s, including the U.S. Bank and its subsidiaries, to allow the dirigibles. They were also allowed to dock on top of each other, so as to cut open the doors of the rooms�� and so as to show that the doors could be opened without interfering with the other openings, and thus open themselves.

In 1947 and 1948 I.M.P.'s, which later merged with BDO Holding Co., opened the first dirigible (the "Fury"), in which a twin twin-engine, electric monoplane operated in the main chamber and mounted on the crane to steer the plane (the "Cockpit") or cargo.

At one point, the company operated 16 aircraft, including about 10 U.S. combat airplanes in World War II.

By the 1950s, my co-founders had established numerous flying companies, including the Aircraft Production Company of Chicago.
