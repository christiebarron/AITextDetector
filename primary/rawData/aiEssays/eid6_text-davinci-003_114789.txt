Building the Empire State Building in the early twentieth century was a technical marvel, made even more incredible by its frequent incorporation of new technologies. From the moment of its conception, the Empire State Building’s building planners had a novel goal in mind–to incorporate airships and dirigibles into the skyscraper’s design. This desire to create a new and innovative type of mooring element is described in detail in ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

Constructing a structure that could safely accommodate heavier-than-air aircraft posed multiple challenges for the Empire State Building’s engineers. One of the most significant problems was reinforcing the building’s foundation to withstand the immense stress from airships docking within the building. Before the building’s engineers could press forward with the project, they had to figure out a way to anchor the dirigibles to the building without causing structural damage. To achieve this, the engineers decided to build a steel and concrete spire on top of the building. This spire, called the mooring mast, became the Empire State Building’s distinctive crown and provided a sturdy landing place for airships of all sizes.

The engineers also had to devise a system of pulleys that allowed the airships to be securely tied to the mast without causing damage. This system of pulleys and ropes could hold up to seven hundred tons of weight, allowing airships
