To the Reader of the _______ News:

As technology continues to evolve, so too does the presence of computer and internet use. It is important to evaluate the positive and negative effects this technology has on its users.

The ease of access and the wide range of information found on computers are great advantages of using the devices. It has enabled individuals to do more in a lesser period of time, as well as become more educated in topics of interest due to the wealth of knowledge online. Computers have allowed people to stay better connected, conversing with friends and family around the world in ways never before thought possible.

However, this technology can also be incredibly damaging to individuals. Those who become too reliant on their computers may find themselves losing touch with people in their own communities as well as suffering from disrupted sleep, withdrawal symptoms, and lack of nutrition. This can lead to physical or mental health problems and can affect all aspects of a person’s life.

It is important to realize that, while computers can offer people many great opportunities, they can also take away from people’s lives. We must stay aware of how much time we are spending on computers and ensure that we are still maintaining healthy relationships and engaging in activities we enjoy outside of technology.

I urge the readers to be mindful of their computer use and strive to find a healthy balance.

Sincerely,
