The author of Winter Hibiscus Minfong Ho, ends with this line to emphasize the main theme of resilience. The line also serves as a reminder to the protagonist, Ah-Kim, to not give up even when faced with a seemingly impossible challenge.  Ah-Kim is not confident in her studies, and is struggling to pass her entrance exam for a better school. However, the line communicates that Ah-Kim is determined to pass the exam and never give up. The image of the hibiscus blooming when the snows melt, the geese returning, and spring approaching serves as a metaphor for Ah-Kim's resilience. The line also suggests that regardless of obstacles, Ah-Kim will remain resilient and try again each time she fails.
