The question of what material should be available for consumption in libraries is a delicate one, especially when it comes to controversial issues like censorship. Some might hold the opinion that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves when they are deemed “offensive” or otherwise inappropriate. However, from a public policy perspective it is unacceptable to grant those in power the freedom to decide what materials we can be exposed to, as it jeopardizes a basic constitutional right: that of freedom of information.

Public libraries, for example, are meant to be a hub for access to a wide variety of media and entertainment. While it is understandable that some objectionable material may slip through the cracks, libraries should never be allowed to censor the material available to their patrons. We all need to remember that the ultimate purpose of public libraries is to provide access to knowledge; and without access to books, movies, magazines, and music, we cannot make informed decisions about the topics that affect all of us. By censoring the contents of the library, we give those in power an undue influence over what people read, watch, and listen to, and thus limit our ability to think for ourselves.

Censorship of public libraries not only violates constitutionally enshrined rights; it also places unbalanced power in the hands of those doing the censoring. By limiting access to certain materials, libraries can be used to propagate one-sided political views or ideologies.
