I remember a time when I was visiting my grandmother in the hospital. I hadn't seen her in months because of the pandemic, so I was really excited to spend some quality time with her. As we talked, I could tell that she was in a lot of pain. She had recently had surgery and the recovery process was going to take some time. Even though it was difficult for her, she was still very patient. 

She would periodically stop our conversation and take a deep breath or two, but throughout it all, she kept her temper in check and didn't say or do anything that would make the situation more stressful. To this day, I'm still in awe of her patience and resilience. It's something that I'm still learning to do myself and I don't think I'll ever be as patient as she was.
