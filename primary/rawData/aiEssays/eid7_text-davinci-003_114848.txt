My family and I had just booked a holiday in a remote part of Scotland. We had been planning the vacation for months and could hardly contain our excitement.

However, traveling to the holiday destination was a nightmare. Our flight was delayed multiple times and at the airport, the only option available was a very small, overcrowded plane.

Everyone was very frustrated and in a foul mood, but I knew that the only way to get through the situation was to be patient. I didn't allow myself to join in the grumbling and instead stayed calm. 

I used the time to read and chat to the passengers around me. Eventually, the tiny plane, which looked like it should have been retired over a decade ago, touched down and we limped into our destination.

The holiday was better than we could have ever imagined and it proved to me that patience really does pay off.
