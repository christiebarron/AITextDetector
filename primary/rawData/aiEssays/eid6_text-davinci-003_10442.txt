The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. Constructed between 1929 and 1931, the Empire State Building was designed by architects Shreve, Lamb and Harmon to include a mooring mast to attach dirigible airships. The idea to include the mooring mast to the 102 story skyscraper was proposed by General Byron, an expert on dirigibles and the President of the American Revolutionary Airship Corporation.

The mooring mast was an impressive addition, reaching 200 feet in the air and capable of hosting airships weighing up to 70 tons. However, there were some technical challenges to overcome if the mooring mast was to be of practical use to airships. The first issue was the size of the mooring mast. Even when attached to the Empire State Building, the mast was still not quite as tall as the airship would have to travel to be able to dock safely. To solve this problem, engineers proposed erecting a giant steel spire on the roof of the Empire State Building, which would extend another one hundred and fifty feet above the mooring mast.

The mooring mast also needed to be reinforced, to be able to handle the force created by an approaching dirigible. To do this, engineers installed four steel arms that were securely connected to the mast. In addition, the mast was reinforced with at least one set of scissor-type steel braces,
