The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

It's now common practice to create a "diving table" (a small, metal container for the air you breathe) on top of a dome or other structure to allow pilots to see the "sky". This is used in both airships and submarines. It was more common then to build a "space deck" which included a "sky crane" to lift the aircraft.

The U.S. government did consider some of these systems somewhat ingenious when it was developing an airship in 1874, but they were in general inefficient. As a result, they had to implement some sort of "warp effect" on their existing systems. The U.S. government did this using its own method of "sculpturing" the outer exterior of the building, creating a series of spiral panels that became a great tool for aeronautical warfare.

In order to construct a "turbulent and dramatic dome" the U.S. government built two of these "turbulent panels" in the mid 1870s, by utilizing the same plan as the original U.S. Navy "sky deck" (this would include a large, glass-sided structure attached to a spiral structure). Both prototypes are shown below in full scale at 20 meters, with no windows or other significant differences.
