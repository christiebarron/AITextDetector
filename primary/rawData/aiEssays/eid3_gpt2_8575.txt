Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

1)

Lateral acceleration is the most common form of action a cyclist takes. The cyclist tends to walk slower because if he pushes himself further, he will end up in the ground or getting hit by a car. Similarly if the cyclist tries twice to make the first jump, he will lose time. Conversely the cyclist does not use much lateral acceleration but would do better to remain still and not try to make it too far up. In general you can see this also happens if the cyclist is in a low angle of travel. For instance if a guy puts his hand behind the headlight he can get hit in short order at times (depending on whether it was at speed or not) so if he does that he can do an awful lot of damage. In fact when the cyclist slows down or goes over the limit, he can't take up a lot of space either. On the other hand if the cyclist is out of space he can have a great deal of movement and get past more cars or other obstacles like potholes or overpasses and this can be very dangerous to the cyclist in front of you if your car is stuck or you see a pedestrian coming. This is also where an action in this space in action might get really close to being considered normal in some way.

So how do I tell whether this level of 'quick and easy' will be 'normal
