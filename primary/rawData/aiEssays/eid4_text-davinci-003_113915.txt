This ending serves as a metaphor for hope and optimism in the face of adversity. The speaker is referring to a difficult test that was taken at the beginning of the story and failed. Despite being discouraged and despondent, the speaker finds hope in the fact that when the winter ends and spring returns, the challenge of the test still stands, signifying a potential for a new beginning and a possibility of success. The return of the geese also represents the return of new beginnings. The hibiscus, which was also present in the beginning, serves as a reminder of strength and resilience despite the harsh winter conditions that it can endure.
