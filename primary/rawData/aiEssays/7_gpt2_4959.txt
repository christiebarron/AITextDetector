An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an elderly man, who was in the hospice area and had started seeing new people in the night.

This woman with a severe illness had gone on to give birth to twins in the hospice and it is difficult for me to talk about a long time ago about how they came up with the twins or how we raised them.

Most recently, though, I watched a documentary called 'The Life of a Cured' on a special series produced by Dr. Michael Jablonski and I became aware of and engaged with this topic.

This subject was recently tackled by my boyfriend, who was still struggling with a chronic form of MS as well as this condition. We have an interview that started at 3:30am and I have to say is worth the effort because I am not alone in this.

This is my favourite episode of The Doctors series on VH1 on ABC. In this episode I was talking to Dr. Michael Jablonski and I am telling him how he has found so many people with this, how their lives have changed in justisin a few days and how he has also seen some of their unique lives. It came out in the summer of 2008 for the first time last fall.

Dr. Jablonski said from the outset that he wanted his viewers to understand about this condition and that he did not like it as they were being treated like patients
