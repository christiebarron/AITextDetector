Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Nowadays, technology is part of our everyday lives, and computers have become essential tools for almost everything we do.

I believe that computers have made a significant impact on us, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, computers offer us many advantages. They can solve a wide variety of problems quickly and easily. They also provide us with easy access to a lot of information, making it easier for us to stay informed. Moreover, computers can help with communication. We can stay connected with people all over the world and make new friends with just a few clicks of a mouse.

At the same time, computers can also cause people to become isolated and dependent on technology. Technology may have made some aspects of our lives easier, but it could also make us lazier. People are increasingly spending more time in front of their computer screens instead of going outdoors and engaging with their surroundings. It is argued that this could negatively affect human interactions, as well as physical and mental health.

Therefore, I believe that it is important to find a balance between taking advantage of the benefits of computers and avoiding overuse. We should strive to make the most out of technology by using it in a positive way and still find time to go out, interact with people, and maintain a healthy balance.

Sincerely,
