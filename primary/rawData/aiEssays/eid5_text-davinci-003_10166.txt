Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives offers an intimate exploration of the life of a young Cuban-American artist. The mood created in Rodriquez’s memoir is one full of nostalgia and longing. Through his lyrical language, Rodriguez paints a vivid portrait of his upbringing in New Jersey, as well as his visits to Cuba with his father, conveying the complicated emotions of a child of immigrants.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez sprinkles in vignettes of his childhood, such as visiting the library with his father on Saturdays and listening to stories about the cuban revolution to playing card games with his abuelo. His memoir is filled with nostalgia, exploring his perception of the world from a young age and the memories that follow him into adulthood. Despite the joy these memories bring, there’s a bittersweet feeling as he recalls the difficult times his family struggled with due to their status as immigrants. He has difficulty expressing the loneliness and homesickness he felt from not being able to connect with his Cuban heritage.

The theme of longing and nostalgia is also evident in his paintings. He paints to commemorate the memories of his family, both happy and sad, and in his artwork he connects his Cuban heritage with his American identity. Rodriguez’s memoir is beautiful in its exploration of nostalgia and longing, and it’s this sentiment that ties the work together. The mood created in From Home is one of hope
