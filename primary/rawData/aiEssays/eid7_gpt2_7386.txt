An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father. He had already lost his family, but he wanted the family they loved to stay with. He wanted my brother and sisters to stay with him. Even though we were friends together he still loved us. And he wanted love and happiness. I had no problem making sure that my brother and sisters remained with me to look after my children. We used to spend a lot of money on our own clothes so that we can do our best.


What about kids? Do you feel that your kids are a force to be reckoned with? I am not an actress and my job is to be like my father. It is not because of my children but because of my father's decisions. He doesn't like his children. He doesn't like his parents. He doesn't like people like his daughters even though he can take it for granted. I want my children to feel respected in my life, not because they're nice; not because they're good or great, but because they are real.


Thank you to my mother and father for your patience, your support and your patience.
