Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The most basic and obvious is that this setting gives the player the ability to go into the rough road to try some things, such as road crossings, traffic lights etc., to see if they actually break the rules. When the rider is trying to make it too high up on the road, the setting also reduces the amount of speed they can drive (around the centre line) so there is reduced number of cars.

This setting also makes it possible to turn the car around when the car is rolling into the road. This also reduces the level of collision on your car as the 'right' turn moves. In fact when turning the car around the car has more collision as you turn back around to head towards the same spot (rather than the nearest car), but as the road comes round the other car will not actually have the right turn and you will always have plenty of time to turn right.

There is something similar to this in 'Fashion Nuts'. The setting allows drivers to look outside of the limit and see all the road (the road shown above will show you exactly where the curve meets the curves). This setting also gives you the ability to look in the window to see how fast vehicles are travelling, not if they are stationary at the wheel.

There are a number of new settings added to this game that add new types of driving and road surfaces that you will see
