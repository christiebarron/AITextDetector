The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first problem was that they were expensive, at $4.6 million to build and had to pay hefty federal royalties for their work. Also, the building's facade, the first on Earth, was not up to scratch, and some builders did not want its design to be "like our previous, more modern building."

The second problem was that the Empire State Building had only 30 apartments for residents and was only 6,000 square feet of space at the time. This combined with its lack of public spaces or public buildings to build buildings in meant that even though it offered an abundance of outdoor space, many builders used them as space for their homes.

The third obstacle was the complex's lack of public housing. The Empire State Building in the 1970s was one of the most popular housing projects in California. It had more than 100,000 people living on the site, which also had plenty of housing for its residents. Some of its newer apartments were on private land and would also be open to the public for private use. All of these issues meant that builders who tried to build the Empire State Building should be reminded of their original vision and that they had the option of getting financing for a building.

Construction of the Empire State Building began in 1974. It became public property in 1979 and closed just five months later. The building was built after the California Convention and Exhibition Center in
