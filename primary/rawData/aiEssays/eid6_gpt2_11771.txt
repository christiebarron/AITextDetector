The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the 18th century, the Federal government provided the Federal Aviation Administration with a vehicle that connected airplanes, tanks and powerlines. But a new propulsion system also required the FAA to be able to connect the aircraft to the ground. And since they weren't able to do so without a special parachute, it's hard to get a reliable parachute from the ground.

This post is part of a series on this kind of equipment at the Museum of the American Civil War.
