The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a vivid reminder how profoundly important a life that entails is.

The book ends with a touching read: "The first time we came off the set of The Matrix was when I was 11 years old; every other kid there. We were standing in the middle of a group of teenagers who wanted to say hello to us when they left. We sat in the back of the car with these little kids, holding hands and going, 'Oh that's me.' It was like that was where I was. It was how they lived their lives."
