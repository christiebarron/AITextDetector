I remember one time when I was in college walking to class with my best friend. We had been through so much together that the conversations we shared never stopped. On this particular day, something I said brought about a burst of laughter between us that was almost tangible, like a wave of energy that couldn't escape. I wasn't even sure what I had said that sparked such a ridiculous response, but my friend was doubled over, tears streaming from her eyes.

At first, I was a bit embarrassed, feeling like I had made a fool of myself; however, when I realized that the laughter was coming out of our shared joy and appreciation of the moment, I couldn't help but join her in the hilarity. We were both laughing so hard that people were looking at us, but it didn't matter because I knew she was the only person in the world who would have appreciated the moment and the joke as much as I did. 

The laughter seemed to last forever, reconnecting us again in a way we hadn't felt in a while. When it finally subsided, I looked at her and said, “I think it’s good to laugh together.” And that we did, again and again, cementing our friendship for many more years to come.
