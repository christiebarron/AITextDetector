The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has caused many people and journalists to question the motives of the media.

"If you have a story about what happened as a young man — and there's quite a few young people who are quite knowledgeable about these characters — it is a bad thing. It is very damaging to all of us. I just don't understand why some journalists are saying: 'Look, this is a story about a boy who's killed. He's been through a lot.'

"But if you give them a story about all these stories, and they are telling one particular guy's story and the other's story, and they say his story and the other's story, well I guess that is a lot more than the case, so I don't think that counts, but I don't think it should.

"And if we all look at the media, it might be better and I don't think that's something. If we all write the same things, then I think that the way we're doing our job, how we think about stories, what we read, what we do, I don't think that will work. I don't think you can live in a world, and if you don't understand the reality, in some cases a journalist will not even respond."
