Dear Editor,

As someone who has experienced firsthand the impact of computers on our lives, I feel compelled to share my opinion with your readers. Today, computers have become an integral part of our life. While there are clear benefits to be gained from using computers, there are some drawbacks that should be considered as well. 

To begin with, it cannot be denied that computers are invaluable tools for the modern workplace. With the help of computers, tasks can be completed faster and more efficiently. Additionally, computers have revolutionized communication, making possible global connections and collaborations.

On the other hand, the omnipresence of computers can also be detrimental to some, especially those who are not tech savvy. It can be difficult for those people to keep up with technological advancements, therefore making them feel inadequate. Furthermore, computers can impede meaningful conversations, create physical inactivity due to prolonged sitting and lead to unhealthy levels of stress.

I believe that we need to be mindful of how computers have shaped our lives and find a healthy balance between relying on technology and living a meaningful life. We should make use of computers and technology, but not let them take over our lives. 

I hope your readers will recognize the need to minimize relentless computer usage and rethink how to best use technology for the benefit of our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
