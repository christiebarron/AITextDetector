This is the speaker in the poem reflecting on the cycle of life. By referencing the return of the geese, the melting of the snow, and the blossoming of the hibiscus, the speaker is making a comparison between the natural world, which is always in motion, and life, which similarly is never static. In this moment the speaker is reflecting on their own personal growth and learning, and the idea that, when the test of life presents itself again, they will be able to make a better effort the next time around.
