The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was one of the most ambitious architectural achievements of the early 20th century. Although the building was primarily designed to stand as a symbol of American prosperity and innovation, its planners envisioned the addition of a novel feature: allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. Despite the fact that the plans for the building included the necessary features for airship mooring, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were more intricate than they initially expected.

The first and most obvious obstacle was the building's design. The factors that had to be taken into consideration were extensive; not only did the building have to be strong enough to withstand the airships, but it had to be tall enough to provide a safe clearance above the city. After much debate, the builders decided to build the tower with a mast at the top specifically for mooring dirigibles. This mast, which was nicknamed the ‘Mooring Mast’, was 285 feet tall and used a set of two rotating airships for mooring and unmoored at a 45-degree angle.

Another major obstacle was safety. In order to ensure the safety of spectators and passengers, the engineers had to create and implement a plan to secure airships as they docked. To provide the maximum stability and precaution, the engineers designed a system of cables and pulleys that ran from the
