I recently had to take my elderly grandmother to the hospital for a medical procedure. Grandma was scared and anxious about the whole thing, and wasn't sure how the procedure was going to go. She was also quite forgetful and had a hard time keeping up with the instructions from the doctors and nurses. Despite all of this, I remained patient. I took the time to explain things to her clearly and showed her that I cared about her wellbeing. I kept a positive attitude and answered any questions she had without any frustration. By the end of the visit, Grandma was more relaxed and thanked me for my patience. I was glad I was able to be supportive and understanding for her.
