I had been friends with my neighbor, John, since I was a kid. We'd grown up together, playing tag or weathering summer rains on the porch, but in college, we'd somehow lost touch.

A few months ago, I ran into him downtown. He told me his grandmother had recently passed away. She had been a huge part of his life, and while he tried to tell the story bravely, I could tell he was struggling.

At the mention of his grandmother’s name, we both burst into involuntary laughter. It wasn’t mirthful or joyous—it was more that kind of release that comes when something is such-sad-it’s-funny. We kept laughing until tears came to our eyes, then talked for hours until the sun went down.

I’d forgotten how good it felt to laugh with someone like John. It was more than just a release—it was a way of understanding each other that couldn’t happen with words. Later, I realized that it was a sign that our friendship hadn’t really gone away, only been on pause. I’m grateful for that moment of understanding and comfort. I couldn’t imagine a better way to reconnect.
