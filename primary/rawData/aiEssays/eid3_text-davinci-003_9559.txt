In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting as they journey through the warped landscape. To begin, the cyclist is faced with a steep grade ahead, forcing them to expend a large amount of energy to traverse it. This grade not only requires the cyclist to expend a great deal of energy but also exposes them to the elements and increases the difficulty and danger of the climb. Additionally, the features of the setting also create physical obstacles, as the road is littered with large rocks, potholes and gravel that become increasingly difficult to maneuver as the climb grows steeper and more treacherous. 

The environment of the setting also creates fear and a sense of danger in the cyclist. The landscape is dark and the shadows are long, as if the darkness itself is a character in the scene. In addition, the sound of the wind and the rain reinforce the fear and danger of the climb, as they seem to be echoing off the sharp rocks and turns. Finally, the cyclist is confronted by a bleak and unforgiving horizon, as the grade leads to a distant, forbidding peak. 

In conclusion, the diverse features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" create an atmosphere of fear and danger that greatly affect the cyclist. The cyclist must not only traverse a steep and treacherous grade, but they must also confront physical obstacles and a bleak, forbidding horizon. Through Kurmaskiâ€™s
