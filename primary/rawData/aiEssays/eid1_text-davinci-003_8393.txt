I recently visited my mom at the hospital after she had surgery. While she was recovering, I was worried and anxious - I wanted her to get better as soon as possible. 

Instead of hashing out my fears, as we waited to hear news from the doctors, I kept my composure and tried to remain patient. I kept busy by reading magazines in the waiting room, willing the minutes to go faster. 

Even when the doctor said it could take longer than expected for my mom to recover, I stayed positive and made small conversation to take my mind off the situation. 

After a few days, my mom was able to go home. Though it was hard, my patience paid off, and I'm relieved she was able to go home in one piece.
