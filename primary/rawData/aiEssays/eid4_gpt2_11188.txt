The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has a story by the very best writers from my own background and background as a writer at the time and the one writer I have come over since the first version of its pages and never met. It's filled with beautiful memories, poignant anecdotes, beautifully written dialogue and amazing action sequences. In fact, it's absolutely beautiful. I actually enjoyed my first version of this book by far. It's very enjoyable with the very simple prose and the unique writing style used. You'll be able to tell the story so it's not so convoluted and it's not like there should be much of a story being told on this website.
