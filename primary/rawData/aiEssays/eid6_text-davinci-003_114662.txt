The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City presented many obstacles for architects and engineers in the 1930s due to the unique task of accommodating the docking of dirigibles. This was largely unheard of in the era and many complex factors had to be taken into consideration. In particular, the structure was required to be able to withstand the drastic weight and force of the airships upon landing. As such, a system known as the mooring mast was designed to provide critical support to aircraft docking while also providing essential safety measures for those on board and those on the ground.

The mooring mast structure was designed to be very tall, reaching 531 feet and surpassing the highest storey of the Empire State Building. This was done to facilitate a safe landing of the airship above any obstructions, and because of their great heights, the masts needed to be built with extreme precision and stability. This necessitated the use of very strong and durable steel parts to construct it, comprising tens of thousands of parts that required intensive labour to assemble and keep them secure. 

The mooring mast structure also had to be embedded with a mechanism that was capable of reliably detaching the airship in the event that winds were too strong to allow for safe entry. This was achieved by installing a hook system that could secure the airship, and if required, could quickly release it without causing structural damage. After the mooring mast was successfully installed, numerous
