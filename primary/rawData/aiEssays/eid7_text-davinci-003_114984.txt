I was grocery shopping and there were several people in line ahead of me. The cashier was slowly ringing up each person's items and the line wasn't moving at all. I was feeling incredibly impatient but I tried my best to remain patient. I knew it wasn't the cashier's fault and I knew that it was just a part of life that things don't always move at the speed you want. So I just breathed and tried to get lost in my own thoughts. After what felt like an eternity, it was my turn. The cashier was incredibly apologetic for the wait, but I just smiled and said it was no problem. I think the cashier was surprised by my response, but I was just happy that I was able to do something I generally find difficultâ€”being patient.
