The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is more of a personal journey than a narrative or a scientific study. It's more about people moving outside of the confines of academia and getting back to the real world, living their dream of being able to create truly innovative things without a financial reward.

Shelley Miller

"It's as simple as that," she says. "It's as beautiful as anything you can get your hands on, but there was an end to it once I realized that I've never been able to look at a picture of any woman without looking at an image of men who make an image out of them."

Shelley Miller's second book is called "From Home," as is her second memoir, from her bookshop in the United States. At the time in "From Home I'm Not a Woman" is an interview with Miller, in which she explains how men have left her in a "feminist culture" and how that experience has put her on the path to self-acceptance as well (she went on to write about having sex with men).

The book is also a companion piece to "From Home: The Journey Through The Glass House," which was released this month. It's not without flaws, too: the author, who has an early crush on Taylor Swift, was just shy of being able to talk publicly about her journey with Swift, and is not in a position to speak publicly with Swift
