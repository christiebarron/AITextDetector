One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a man who had left his country of birth into the UK and I was living out in the woods walking on the countryside. It was the first time in my life that I felt my own laughter. I've got to know the person who made me laugh and to remember how much I appreciate it. So it is with sadness that I cannot tell you how much I love all of you.

I'm sorry but, without apology, we've been doing a little bit of'rejuvenate' for some time now. So what are you up to?

I'm up for a bit more, and I'm still not quite 100% focused on the season yet. I haven't tried writing or acting yet, so I can't go into what I'm doing right away. I only know myself and this is the only way we know who I am. It's my second try in the series.

Do you miss any of us?

We still have an endless desire to play along. But in my head I do have one thing in particular I like, and this is the story I've always loved about the show and this was what we want to do it for - the story that we love.
