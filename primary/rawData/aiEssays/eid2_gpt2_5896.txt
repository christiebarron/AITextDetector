I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has an important role to play in our society. But is it possible, to allow a certain kind of freedom in the way that an individual can choose to believe in and think about his own rights, when the person is not constrained by these facts? The answer is 'no'.


For what do we believe about any given issue?


The fact that the content of certain texts is publicised does not always mean that they are free from restrictions that are perceived to prejudice those under different social backgrounds and lifestyles. These laws cannot, as the government may insist, be used to censor any individual freedom.


But there must always be some truth to such claims. We cannot deny or justify the existence of laws that might be seen to favour one group or other group by allowing others to express their opinion – even against their own wishes – but there can be no excuse when all sorts of social and political groups are involved.


I hope that you would give us a reading of the debates over government-imposed bans on certain types of literature because we think that's not what's going to happen. We don't think it's going to happen if the government, who has a very substantial and open democracy, does not say that we have those things as part of our constitution. We'll find out if the government would like to go further, say that it would like to remove restrictions on books and even other forms of expression in books. And that
