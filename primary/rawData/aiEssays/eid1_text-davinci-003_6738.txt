Dear Editors,

I recently read a report indicating that computers are playing a larger role in our lives each day. As a result, I have developed a strong opinion on the effects these devices have on people.

I believe the impacts are overwhelmingly positive. Computers enable us to do almost anything â€“ from controlling our thermostats and lighting to helping us shop online, go to school, and complete work remotely. We are able to communicate with people from all around the world in a variety of different ways. Computers are an essential tool for us to remain connected and productive in our lives.

A common fear surrounding computers is that they will steal away jobs and disconnect us from the world. But the truth is, computers only make up a part of our lives; they do not replace or replace human relationships. Computers help remove time-consuming paperwork and create more efficiency. They also provide a platform for us to learn and become more creative. In addition, they are vital tools for conducting research.

In conclusion, I feel that the benefits of computers outweigh the detriments. Computers allow us to communicate in ways we never could before, and open us up to new and exciting possibilities. I therefore encourage readers to use computers in moderation to remain connected to the world and take advantage of the powerful and innovative benefits they offer.

Sincerely,
