The Empire State Building was designed to accommodate dirigibles upon its completion in 1931, making it the first edifice in the world built specifically to provide docking space for airships. While the architects anticipated this to be an easier feat than constructing similar towers in Europe, the builders of the Empire State Building soon found themselves facing formidable obstacles.

The engineers of the Empire State Building originally planned to have the mast, designed to function as a mooring mast for the incoming dirigibles, constructed atop the building's famous spire. However, due to the weight of the mast, the spire was unable to support it. The architects were forced to locate the mast on the 86th floor roof. This necessitated the installation of a powerful winch to pull the airships into their berthing positions.

Additionally, inclement weather, such as high winds and heavy rains, posed a significant threat to successful berthing. In order to protect the airships from these weather conditions, the engineers designed an extensive masts shield or canopy that would protect the airships while berthing. This shield covered the northern half of the roof and was secured in place with steel cables and bars.

Finally, the architects also had to develop an efficient system for controlling the air traffic in the area, taking into consideration the number of airships that were expected to dock. A local office was established in the Empire State Building for controlling the air traffic as well as communications with the air
