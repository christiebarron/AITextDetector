Dear Editors of the ___________ Newspaper, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on our lives. With the rise of artificial intelligence, our lives have changed drastically and our dependence on technology has grown immensely. 

We are now able to easily and quickly access information like never before. Computers have made our lives easier in many ways. We are now more connected to the world and with social media, it has become easier to share our thoughts and opinions with others. Additionally, the internet has made the transmission of information incredibly efficient. 

However, this increased technology also has its drawbacks. As we become more and more reliant on electronic devices, our communication skills are suffering. Interpersonal interaction is no longer as prevalent as it once was, as people now turn to their screens for entertainment and communication. Furthermore, an over-reliance on computers has caused information overload, which can lead to stress and anxiety. 

I believe that computers should be used as tools to enhance our lives and not as a crutch to replace real-life interactions and activities. Therefore, we should be mindful of our computer usage and to use technology responsibly. 

Thanks for your time and consideration. 

Respectfully,

[Your Name]
