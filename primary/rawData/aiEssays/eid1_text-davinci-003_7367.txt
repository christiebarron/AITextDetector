In the story ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski, the setting of the story is a quiet, rural town in Arizona. This small, isolated area has a strong impact on the cyclist featured in the story.

Firstly, the isolation of the setting has a major effect on the cyclist as it gives the cyclist a sense of invisibility which allows the cyclist to fully immerse themselves in the journey. This anonymity also translates to safety, as the cyclist is unlikely to come across people who may potentially be dangerous. Furthermore, the presence of the sand and barren desert allows the cyclist to have a sense of freedom that could not be found in a highly populated area. 

The cyclist also takes comfort in the fact that they could take a moment to relax in the shade of the cactuses provide by the setting. After a long day of riding under the blazing sun, the cyclist can rest and let their mind wander while the wind blows through the grass and the sun shines through the clouds.

In addition, the quietness of the desert allows for contemplation and self-reflection, something that is difficult to do in the hustle and bustle of the city. The desert provides the cyclist with a perfect opportunity for self-discovery and personal transformation. The vastness of the desert also serves as a metaphor for the cyclist’s greater journey, providing a sense of scale and perspective to the cyclist’s life.
