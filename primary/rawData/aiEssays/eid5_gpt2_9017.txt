The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (2004), which was made with his friend and collaborator, has drawn considerable attention in the US literary community to the book itself. It has been published from April 2009 until Christmas of the following year and is expected to hit in the US this month. The short is titled 'In My Back Yard, Between My Backyard and Their House'. It features several moments from John's childhood.

In the video, released this year on the website Vimeo, the interviewer interviews John about his life, writing in his diary that for the past year he has been living in New York with a dog, his wife, his girlfriend and his children.

Mr McKellen later tells The Independent that the book is "very touching" and he was "very conscious of where he and I are heading but I didn't know where we were headed". He added "I just felt that a lot of people had forgotten about us. It was hard. I don't mean it's embarrassing for them but for you you are very different person, both friends and family."

The book was published in the US in February 2009, on the website American Memoirs; it was sold across Australia for AU$23,087 (£629; £858).

In May, The Independent, the magazine that ran the interview, published an article about the book on Monday.
