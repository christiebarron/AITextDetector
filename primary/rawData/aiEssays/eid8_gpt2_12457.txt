One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I witnessed "I'm a crazy person." I thought a stranger who was in the hall and laughing was going to laugh at us. What if their face looked so bad? What if they saw me coming off my back? Would they try to tell me that they didn't like me? Would they take this joke as an indication that I might not want to be around friends? Or I would have the feeling that I was being deliberately mischaracterized in public?


In this current crisis, I have a new perspective when it comes to how we as our society should respond to situations like these. In my career, I have worked with professionals who have put their trust in me even as I try to be proactive about dealing with all of these problems, but it has been my experience that people in charge tend to have a very tough-to-reach position. I don't want to fall into this category. Because I truly believe that we are so different, and we must learn to live in a more collaborative environment.


I would like to hear some thoughts on making sense of this information from your perspective and how you see it. And I'd also like to hear your thoughts on the current state of the art for dealing with "crisis" situations. Can I be a little too open toward these things? How do you approach problems when they are clearly and clearly "clear" and "clear to hear"?
