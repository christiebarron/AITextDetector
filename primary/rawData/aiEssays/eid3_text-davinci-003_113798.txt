In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in numerous ways.

Firstly, the cyclist is confronted by the harsh environment of the mountain range he is attempting to traverse, with its steep rocky trails, shifting sand, and sparse vegetation. The natural features and terrain of the mountain range provide a formidable physical obstacle to the cyclist, continually testing his strength and endurance as he makes his arduous journey. 

The timing of his ride also has an impact on the cyclist's journey. The cyclist chooses to ride during the day, when the sunlight is beating down harshly on the harsh terrain. This amplifies his difficulty, as he is subjected to the full force of the heat during his difficult trek. The subtleties of the natural features of the mountain range, such as the wind blowing through the crevices and the light reflecting off the sand, add to the overall impact of the setting on the cyclist. 

The various manmade features of the mountain range also significantly affect the cyclist. The abandoned mine shafts located throughout the range provide a unique physical and psychological hazard, as the cyclist is faced with the potential danger of them collapsing while making his way through them. Additionally, the presence of the rattlesnakes and other creatures that call the mountain range home demonstrate the wild, untamed nature of the setting, creating a powerful atmosphere and further testing the cyclist's strength.
