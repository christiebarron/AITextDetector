The construction of the Empire State Building was a feat of human engineering and a landmark of both architecture and technological achievement. Envisioned as a home and welcoming point for large dirigibles, the vision of the Empire State Building allowing ships to dock atop if it is one of the more iconic features of the building. However, that functionality was not so easy to implement. 

The greatest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock atop the building was the structural integrity of the mooring mast, which was designed to be a sturdy dock for the large airships to rest upon. This mast was a feature that had to be engineered with the utmost precision, and original plans for the mast called for using steel framework to construct it. However, after careful consideration the builders determined that to strong winds this steel framework might easily succumb, leading to a potentially catastrophic disaster. So instead, the builders opted for masonry construction, which provided a much more secure structure.

The next great obstacle was making sure that the mast was able to absorb the shock of the dirigibles docking and undocking, which could be a tremendous jolt and potentially cause damage to the structure and the ships. To address this concern, the builders designed a foundation which would reduce the shock to the mast when it was used. This foundation was suspended between the base of the mast and the main structure of the Empire State Building, and it was designed to act as a
