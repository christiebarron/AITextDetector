An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my fiancee when we went to his house in the south of England and he asked me where my wife was since I was just getting married at the age of 13 in 1986. She told me she is now 27 years old, and told us she had done things like watch movies and read. I don't agree with that - she has been my best friend, and has been in my life ever since. In fact, her only reason I would recommend her is because there is no better way to tell if she is pregnant. I think she is still a bit of a weirdo, and if she is pregnant, we may never be able to have that relationship because she is too little of two kids to conceive before we are back together again.
