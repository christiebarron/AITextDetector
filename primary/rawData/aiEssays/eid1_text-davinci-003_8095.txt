The Empire State Building was revolutionary when it opened in 1931, and was one of the first skyscrapers to incorporate the new technology of allowing dirigible mooring, or docking, at its summit. This ambitious project faced a wide array of obstacles in order to make this a reality.

The first challenge encountered was obtaining approval from the public. The idea of large airships docking atop the Empire State Buildingâ€™s spire was an attractive yet foreign concept that met plenty of scrutiny. The designers needed to prove that mooring dirigibles was safe and efficient. To do this, they tested the docking mechanisms on a much smaller scale using zeppelins and blimps. After their success, the New York City government granted the Empire State Building the rare permit to moor dirigibles.

The logistics of constructing a mooring mast also posed a considerable challenge for the building's engineers. The design team was tasked with creating a mast that was secure, steady, and adjustable. Propulsion units were added to the top of the mast so that the airship could move towards to the dock during windy conditions. The mast was also adjustable so that dirigibles of different sizes could dock with ease. Furthermore, a selection of mooring lines were constructed to secure the airship before it found its footing. 

The third great obstacle of the operation was finding a way to transport passengers and cargo from the mooring platform to the
