The Empire State Building has had a long and illustrious history, but few people are aware of the challenge faced by the builders of the building when they attempted to make it the first safe haven for docking dirigibles. This was no small feat, and the builders encountered a slew of obstacles before securing the structure's mooring mast for this purpose.

The first obstacle facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the necessity of developing new technology to construct the mooring mast. Dirigibles, or airships, of the time were incredibly large and widely varied in size and shape, and the Empire State Building architects had to design a mast to accommodate the multitude of designs. This meant constructing the mast with a broad curved top and sturdy base that was tall enough for the larger models to safely dock.

The second obstacle was the necessity of having the mast strong enough to withstand the weight. As the mooring mast was built, it had to be designed to be able to support the enormous load of an airship. To this end, the builders of the Empire State Building devised an impressive system made of metal cables and a complex grid of steel beams that extended over two-hundred and sixty feet from the observation deck.

A third obstacle to overcome was the wind. Dirigibles, being airships, were naturally affected by far stronger gusts than everyday aircraft, and the builders of the Empire State Building had to ensure that mooring mast was
