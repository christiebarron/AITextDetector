Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on society. Computers have brought about many positive benefits while simultaneously creating potential difficulties in our everyday lives. 

The benefits of computers are undeniable. In modern society, people can work from and swim laps in their own comfort, communicate with others in and out of the country, and shop from the convenience of their own homes. Computers have created jobs and opportunities in a variety of fields, including the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. Additionally, computers have allowed us to gain access to education, news, and entertainment with ease.

However, excessive use of computers can have potential drawbacks, such as physical and emotional health problems. People are sitting for long periods of time in front of the computer, and this can increase the risk of physical conditions such as neck and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and vision problems. Emotional problems such as depression and anxiety can also arise from computer overuse. 

Therefore, as a society we must learn to find the right balance to use computers in a healthy way. We need to prioritize time away from computers and technologies for healthy physical and emotional development. 

Yours sincerely,

[Name]
