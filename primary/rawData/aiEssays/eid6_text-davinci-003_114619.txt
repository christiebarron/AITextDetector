The construction of the Empire State Building was a monumental undertaking, and the inclusion of an unprecedentedly large mooring mast to accommodate dirigibles presented a whole range of obstacles to the builders. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast, the challenges and solutions posed by the task are explored.

When the idea was first presented in the late 1920s, the achievement of such a feat “seemed impossible.” The mast had to be large enough to be structurally sound and support the weight of an airship, which would be no easy task. Additionally, the size of the mast posed another problem: how would an airship safely dock with only one structure in the middle of a bustling city?

In order to address this issue, the architect proposed including “huge heliports” on the roof of the building. These would provide more areas for the airship to dock as well as act as a break for any turbulence from the wind below. However, the heliports provided another challenge – how to get them up to the roof of the building, which stood well above the tallest of ladders. The builders proposed elevators, which had to be specially designed in order to withstand the wind and weight of the airship.

The arrival of the Great Depression presented another obstacle, cutting the funding and creating doubt in the public’s eye regarding the feasibility of the task. However, the
