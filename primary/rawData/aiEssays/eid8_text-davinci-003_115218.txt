I had a great time with my friend Mark at the movies last week. We've known each other for years but he still manages to make me laugh with his witty banter. 

As we're sitting in the theater, the movie was starting to get a bit slow, and it showed. We caught each other's glances and started stifling a laugh. We both started quietly snickering, and soon enough we were slapping our knees and laughing out loud. 

For about five minutes, we couldn't contain our laughter and had the whole theater looking our way. Someone yelled "Hey, can you two be quiet?". Mark just said "No Pee Pee Poo Poo" and we started laughing even harder. I was crying tears of laughter by this point, and we had to leave the theater and wait outside until the film was over. 

It felt like old times, and it reminded me why I love spending time with Mark. His sense of humor is never ending and it always manages to lighten up whatever situation I'm in. Whenever I need a good laugh, I know I can always count on him.
