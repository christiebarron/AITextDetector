I remember one time when I was in a rush to take the bus to get to work on time. Suddenly, a huge crowd of people started running in the opposite direction to me, yelling in loud voices. I was completely overwhelmed. I was sure I was going to miss the bus. To my surprise, I noticed that same crowd was buying tickets for the bus. Even though I was frustrated that the line was so long and it was taking up so much time, I decided to wait with everyone else and remain patient as I was aware this was the only way I could get on to the bus.

Eventually, my patience paid off and I finally got my ticket. I was relieved to be able to board the bus and make it to work on time. Even though the line had taken up time I had planned to spend elsewhere, I had learned the lesson to always remain patient in situations like this, since sometimes patience is really the only way to achieve a desired outcome.
