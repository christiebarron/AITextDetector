Dear Editor,

Computer technology has become a popular tool in the modern society and it is an essential part of our lives. As a result, most people have had some exposure to computers and their effect on people. I believe that computers have improved the global economy, created numerous opportunities for information exchange, and provided us with powerful tools that have enabled an increase in productivity and convenience.

However, while computers can provide us with many benefits, I believe there are some negative effects that should be considered. Technology addiction can be most concerning, as well as the countless distractions presented through social media, emails, messaging, and videos that can keep people from focusing on more important tasks that are pertinent to life. Furthermore, excessive use of computers can be damaging to people’s physical and mental health. Ergonomic issues such as soreness in the eyes, wrists, and shoulders can lead to serious medical concerns. Additionally, technology overload or “brain fatigue” can cause mental exhaustion, lack of motivation, and feelings of isolation.

I think it is important to consider the consequences of computer use in order to take advantage of the positive effects while limiting the potential damages. A balance of computer use with regular physical activities, outdoor exploration, and face-to-face socialization will be important for society to reap the rewards of the powerful digital world without compromising the well-being of people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
