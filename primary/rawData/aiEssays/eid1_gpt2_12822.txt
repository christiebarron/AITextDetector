Computers have many effects on people. The one you see here is that people are much more sensitive to pain. People with arthritis don't have a very nice sense of pain, or touch them, and they tend to lose their sense of smell. People with arthritis don't have touch sensitivity, or touch their skin.

It's kind of strange to think that people can have more subtle things, but it's worth pointing out that the way it works in real life is that you're supposed to know how much you're hurting, or the other side of the world can't tell you that.
