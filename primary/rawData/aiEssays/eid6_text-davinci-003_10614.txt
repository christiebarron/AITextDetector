The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was an impressive feat of engineering. This magnificent structure was an iconic symbol of progress and modernity, representing the emergence of skyscrapers in the early 20th century. However, during its design and construction, there were plans to include a mooring mast structure that would enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This mooring mast was intended to be a part of the Empire State Building for many years, but it ultimately never came to fruition. In his book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted highlights the challenges the construction team faced in attempting to make this ambitious idea a reality.

Despite the fact that the mooring mast would increase the building’s attractiveness to travelers, the team had to overcome many obstacles in order to make it a reality. The main challenge was that the mast structure would need to be built to withstand strong winds of up to 75 mph. Such endurance demanded an incredibly sturdy design, with an intricate web of structural engineering. The construction team had to account for the fact that the building was over 1,000 feet tall, meaning the mooring mast would be exposed to twice or even three times the force of wind compared to structures built at lower altitudes.

The architects of the Empire State Building would also need to come up with a system that allowed for the mooring of multiple dirigibles at once, which
