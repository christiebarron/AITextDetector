The last time my dad and I went out on a fishing boat together it was a really special moment. We just enjoy each other’s company without having to talk. We were just sitting there enjoying the stillness of the lake when I felt a tug on my line. I was so excited but realized, in all of the excitement, I had forgotten to change my line strength. As soon as I tried to reel in the catch the line snapped. 

My dad just started chuckling and said, “well that was a pretty weak effort.”

I started laughing too even though I was disappointed my catch had gotten away. We spent the rest of the afternoon just telling jokes and laughing. 

These moments with my dad are so precious. He’s in his seventies now and those moments of shared laughter are so important. They remind me of how much our relationship means to me. Laughter is an important part of our bond and I cherish the moments when he and I are together and laughing.
