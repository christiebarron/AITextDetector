 

Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. In my opinion, computers are having a net positive impact on society. 

Progress in our modern world necessarily involves the use of technology, and computers in particular are becoming increasingly indispensable in accomplishing even our most basic tasks. From banking and data storage, to accessing information and shopping online, to medical breakthroughs, computers are revolutionizing our lives in ways unimaginable just decades ago. 

Itâ€™s not just that computers are making our lives easier and more efficient, they are also providing a platform for people to connect, communicate and socialize from the comfort of their own homes. We can share photos or videos with loved ones, and use technology to stay in touch with friends and family, no matter the distance. Social media has been a powerful tool for social justice movements, allowing people to connect and share vital information with people all over the world. 

Another benefit of computers is their educational value. Learning is now more accessible than ever before, with a vast array of online opportunities. From virtual classrooms to interactive educational tools, everyone from the youngest child to the most senior adult, can glean invaluable knowledge
