Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In it, the cyclist sees a green light and is ready to make a quick detour. The cyclist might say no, but the person's view of a green light is to their benefit. In these scenarios, cyclists have the right to refuse to use a green light that doesn't comply with their needs.

Of course there is no shortage of examples of the setting being counterproductive, and this does raise the question of whether the cyclist is making the right choice. Is it a "real choice"? What value is added when a car pulls into the intersection and suddenly finds themselves in a traffic jam and loses track of their speed? Or do cyclists have to make the decision anyway?

A third of cycling trips are spent on the road, particularly off the road. The road is often used as a transit hub. With a high-profile "road network" such as the World Trade Centre, there are plenty of bike lanes running throughout the country, as evidenced by the number of pedestrian bays and bollards in the city, as well as on major roads, streets and major thoroughfares of the city and suburbs.

There are clear benefits to avoiding going on the roadmysharing and going more slowly. The effect on the behaviour of pedestrians is quite obvious. A cyclist doesn't need to change positions and keep the speed at a specified speed. The same could be said of
