The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The9th Amendment of the 20th century prohibited the making of "stuffed objects" that would require a special permit. But it was only in 1948, when the FAA began its own "first-responder system" that all aircraft were allowed to dock on open streets under 100 nautical miles. The building was a beacon of hope to the rest of mankind – all those who had wanted to send home a book in case of war. The most remarkable part about the Empire State Building was its architectural inspiration: the original 1818, 2nd floor balcony decked out with glass at least four feet in diameter. A new architectural design found its way into the building in 1960 – an angular and modern model designed by Michael R. White and Thomas O'Hagan. This model is one of only five that were ever built by either architect.

Built in 1929, the Empire State Building is one of only five buildings in the world that are still used by the public for public and private use. Over the last several decades the building has served as a hub for the development of the city's infrastructure. The Empire State building was named after one of the buildings in Dantonville – the historic residence of the first African-American President. Today in the historic Washington Square area, the building stands as a national monument.
