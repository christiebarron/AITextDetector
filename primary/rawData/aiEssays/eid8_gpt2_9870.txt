One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one man asked me why I made an album called "Dope". His face was so happy. I explained there were some bad habits in my life and had some "bad" things he was going through because he was a good boy.

This was when I became a DJ and now I think that is why I love the word "dope", why was the word "dope", why was an album called "Dope" such a great success for me; so quickly became one of my favorite dance music albums. It was hard for me because now I am more than 50 years old so I want to say thanks so much to everyone who gave me the platform that I needed.

There are a lot of projects being developed here in Canada, for example of "Happen Now"-I have decided to call it my "Nakomata-Risk of Failure" project. I am hoping to release this first one this coming summer.

And from the sounds of it I know what it is: The very same guy who did the first Dope CD that I bought back in the middle of the '90s called me a fake artist.
