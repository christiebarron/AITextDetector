Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rough Road Ahead 'Rough Road Ahead' is often used by cycling advocates to refer to new legislation that gives cyclists a 'quick start' over drivers and drivers of bicycles. This legislation gives cyclists the option of moving into the road ahead of road traffic before stopping and at different points in the road ahead. The law will, of course, be used to ensure cyclists will be aware they are not in a risk zone.

Most bikes are built for bicycle use. Road safety initiatives that provide bicycle infrastructure is based on this data. Road safety initiatives work best when they work effectively to prevent accidents, to provide a safe and enjoyable commute, for cyclists and for the environment. Here, the RPOA will be used to improve our communities in a way that works for the people – and the countryside – as well as for the environment.

The RPOA, which in turn builds bridges between areas where cycling has been permitted and where there is no cycling infrastructure, aims the RPOA to make cycling more accessible as part of the City's commitment to support cycling.
