One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 years old. In high school I was in the basement of a house in one of the most desirable parts of the city. It was surrounded by a house with a view into the forest, a big building. It was surrounded by two mountains of trees, many in different forms. It was surrounded by a lake where an old man and several other people grew trees. At that time one of the trees got lost and its trunk exploded open the second day and brought the whole house down. I looked around. There was no sign of any trees that I could see but the house had all three trees. I thought it was just some kind of strange, strange forest.

In this story, our story ends, and the real world gets lost. The reality is much more interesting and disturbing. We didn't think that we were going to survive, but we did imagine that the situation would get more serious and that there were others out there who were still alive.

When the story ends I begin to look for more, and maybe just look at what I didn't know before telling the story. So I look into the future. As much as I know all about it, I don't know exactly what I will actually do. It's a story that I tell about what I now do, but it is also a story about what we saw there. I hope that you can learn of the book by helping it publish.
