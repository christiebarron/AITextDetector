The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there's no real way back to that version of events that happened prior to the events of Winter Hibiscus and that's just not my goal. What makes it so special is that there is so little to not talk about, the little pieces of evidence that are available, the little pieces of evidence that are also possible at all.

The book tells the story of Jorgen, the last ruler of the people of Winter Hibiscus. When Winter Hibiscus took over Jorgen's house, he left several pieces of evidence and some new ones, including the evidence that he said was not part of his plans, a message he's been given by Kristoff that I think will be worth the wait.
