In Joe Kurmaski's short story, “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist's experience is substantially impacted by the features of the setting. The story is set in a seemingly rural part of the United States, most likely in the Midwest. The presence of trees and large patches of land indicate a more rural landscape, where there are fewer vehicles and attention given to cyclists than in a city.

The lack of attention to cyclists by drivers is a crucial element in the story. The flat, open roads with few cars mean drivers are more likely to not see cyclists. This lack of attention leads to a great danger for the cyclist, one that the protagonist is all too aware of. This is highlighted when the cyclist has to pull off the road and wait for a car to pass in order for them to be safe, even though they do not have the legal right to the road. This experience is only made possible by the rural, open roads of the Midwest which lead to the drivers’ neglect of cyclists.

The vastness of the Midwest is also a key element in the story. The roads here often go on for miles without a single house or city in sight. Coupled with the few cars, this creates a dystopian atmosphere of emptiness and isolation. This feeling of being alone in the world is overwhelming for the cyclist and only serves to make the danger posed by careless drivers even more real.
