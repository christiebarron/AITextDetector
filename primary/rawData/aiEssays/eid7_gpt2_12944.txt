An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my husband (who had a diagnosis for cancer in 1987). At that time I would have been diagnosed with all sorts of diseases that were not only life threatening, but could end up costing me my health. A good day to do one thing and do it well.

As I worked on this project I realised that the way that patients in my age bracket were treated in my profession would be far more difficult than I expected. By asking patients to have surgery, including on, which was a lot less difficult and therefore less expensive, I finally had many of the first-line patients in my age bracket get better treatment.

At the same time as these two MechWarriors were getting off the ship, I was able to give them their first shot once more after my wife asked what she thought of the 'new medicine'.

But I had had a very busy and busy life over the years. If I had not been in their life care department for the first few months of my working life, it could have been very different. I am not sure how happy that would have been for a few weeks when I learnt that the 'therapy' had not yet been finished due to its age and cost. I would not have believed that such a thing existed so easily.

And that was when I realised that with an increased workforce, such changes in how young the workforce can be is going way up!
