Dear Editor,

The use of computers has become increasingly more common in recent years. Although society is reliant on technology, it is important to consider all the effects, both positive and negative, it can have on people.

Many believe computers have increased productivity, communication, and entertainment for people in our society. From online courses to digital editing, computers have made it easier to transfer certain knowledge and skills to those using them. The introduction of smartphones has also allowed us to stay connected with our family and friends throughout the world.

On the other hand, some would express concern over the effects of computers. For example, increased dependence on technology can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and decreased physical activity. New technologies have also caused people to disconnect from the world around them as they focus more on their screens.

Despite this, technology can be used in a way that is beneficial to our society. People need to find a sense of balance between using technology and understanding their responsibilities in the physical world. It is important to recognize that we all have a choice how we embrace technology in our lives.

For these reasons, I believe computers are a tool people of any age can use in a productive and safe way.
