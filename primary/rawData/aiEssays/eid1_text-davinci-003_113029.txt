Dear Editor,

I would like to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As a part of the digital age, more and more people are turning to computers in their everyday lives to stay connected, multitask, and do work.

The benefits of using computers in everyday life are undeniable. Not only are computers a great way to stay connected to friends and family in a way that keeps both parties up-to-date with each other's lives, but they are also a great tool for multitasking and collaborating with others on projects.

However, there are also significant drawbacks to relying heavily on computers. Constantly being plugged in can be a distraction, not only to the person using the computer, but to those around them. Also, too much exposure to bright screens can cause eye strain and even headaches.

In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people. The key for successful use of computers is moderation; by using computers in sparingly, limiting time spent using them, and prioritizing face-to-face contact with people and nature, computers can be beneficial and help us stay connected.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
