There are several features of the setting that affect the cyclist in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”. The most obvious of these is the terrain itself. The cyclist is presented with a gravel road that winds its way up a steep mountain, offering up a substantial challenge. This setting not only forces the cyclist to use more energy to ascend the hill, but also increases the risk of injury due to the rough, uneven surface. 

The altitude of the mountain is also part of the setting, and affects the cyclist in several ways. At a higher elevation, the cyclist will struggle to maintain their breathing, with the air much thinner than that found at lower elevations. This could cause respiration fatigue which would further hinder progress. In addition, the cyclist will likely encounter harsher climatic conditions in the form of increased humidity, stronger winds and harsher sunlight, all of which can further sap energy and focus.

Finally, the particular time of day may also influence the cyclist. A mountain climb is considerably more difficult in the heat of the afternoon, when the air is warmer and the sun is blazing, compared to an early morning start. Along with the physical demands, mental difficulties may arise due to the hiker’s waning motivation and fading confidence. 

All these features of the setting can combine to affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead”. The terrain, altitude, climate, and time of day all demand
