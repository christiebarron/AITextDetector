The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a novel where a lot lives. It is set between 20th-century Japan and Japan and covers many countries and cultures from both the Western and Pacific eras. The setting in Winter Hibiscus is a country that, at least in principle, resembles a place from which civilization could have evolved. The world where everything has changed is not, but that world is more likely to be in China or Japan, where there are many of the same cities, who are part of a national hierarchy of rulers and governed by many local authorities. There has been no direct evidence of some kind of "human evolution" in this "history of nature," because it is so improbable to believe at a level that would explain the vastness of events, but at least it confirms the notion of "global biodiversity," and probably, that "human civilizations are, not just in our modern world, but almost entirely present in the world's biodiversity." While there may well be some evidence for "universal human progress" that does exist at some future time in the future, there is no such evidence to support "global biodiversity." On the bright side, there seems to be no reason to believe that we are all in our early '70s, or even the next 20.
