I recently had a girlfriend who taught me the importance of patience. We had been dating for a year and I had impatience tendencies before she came into my life. She was constantly patient and understanding, even if I got frustrated easily.

There was one time we were going to see a play and I forgot to get tickets. I was so embarrassed and angry at myself and I was sure we were going to miss out on the show. But before I had a chance to get too worked up, she calmly said "It's okay, the show is something we can do another time." She also managed to keep me from taking my frustration out on anyone else the rest of the night. I was so impressed with her calmness and patience that it inspired me to be more patient and understanding. 

I'm grateful for that experience and the time I spent with her because she taught me the power of having patience.
