The poet is using the imagery of the winter hibiscus as a metaphor for her personal challenge of taking the test again. The poem is about perseverance and determination; the poet is renewing her vow to take the test again and is making the hibiscus the symbol for her own courage and strength. The poet is also connecting to nature and the cycle of the seasons: the snows melt to usher in spring, just as she will overcome her challenges and start anew. Despite the harsh conditions of winter, the hibiscus survives and will blossom in the spring, just as the poet will successfully take the test. The poet is thus expressing hope in the face of difficulty and ushering in a new beginning.
