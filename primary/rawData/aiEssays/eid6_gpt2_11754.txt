The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle being the fact that the crane on the west side of the structure was actually made of titanium and could not dock more than two units into a single shaft.

As a result, the crane was given its usual steel-reinforced "C" frame where all bearings are bolted down into two cocks. These frames allowed for vertical and horizontal adjustment through the main shaft but for the crane to dock for even less than that. The lack of an overall lock-off means that for most of the time in use there is not even a movement of any length, so the crane is unable to get any of the bearings in.

On another occasion, the crane in the middle was broken. Because they were not used in the building, the bolts on the roof were not snapped from the bolts. Instead of having a fixed tension tension in the crane, it would be necessary to force them up and down after every landing. Because they were being used in a building with an air intake, the steel was not very flexible and its bearings could not be secured to the building for this purpose. Thus a fix was made which would be used for each part of the project.

With the new construction the crane became extremely strong and it would be the first step in getting a real lock
