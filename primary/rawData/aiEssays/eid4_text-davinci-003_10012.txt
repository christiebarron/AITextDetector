The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a triumphant metaphor for resilience in the face of difficulty. The protagonist is taking a test that is difficult for her and she doesn't feel prepared for it. However, she finds strength in the image of her tough hibiscus that will "come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return" and will be stronger than ever. By tying her strength and determination to the resilience of the hibiscus, the protagonist finds confidence within herself to take the test again when the winter has ended.
