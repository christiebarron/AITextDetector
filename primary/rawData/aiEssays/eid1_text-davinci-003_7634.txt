This powerful ending ties in with the themes of struggling to find identity, resilience, and hope. The winter hibiscus symbolizes survival and how when all odds are against one another, the narrator and her family have the strength to get back up and start all over, even after facing seemingly impossible struggles and difficulties. The reference to the test implies that the narrator is confident that her test score in the spring will improve, now that she is better prepared to face it and has the courage and determination of someone who has survived the winter (like the winter hibiscus). The metaphor of a resilient hibiscus, blooming after surviving a harsh winter, reflects the power of the human spirit to come back from life's adversities.
