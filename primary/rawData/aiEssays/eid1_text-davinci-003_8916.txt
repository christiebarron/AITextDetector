Dear Editor: 

As computers become increasingly more commonplace in our lives, it is important to consider the effects they have on people. It is my opinion that computer technology has had both positive and negative impacts on people and that, overall, the positive consequences far outweigh the negative.

The advantages of computers are easy to spot. Computers have improved communication and made it easier for people around the world to stay connected. Knowledge sharing and technological innovation are also greatly facilitated by computers. They are an invaluable tool for people both in and out of the workplace.

On the negative side, there is the risk of health issues associated with prolonged computer use. This includes eye strain or physical pain from the awkward posture that is so common to computer users. Of course, computers can also lead to addiction and internet procrastination, considering that there is an overwhelming amount of distraction and entertainment on the internet.

But while these risks exist, itâ€™s important to focus on the upside of computers. They open new doors by giving people access to resources and information that were once inaccessible. Additionally, they provide rich educational tools and can be used to create wonderful products.

In conclusion, computers have been instrumental in advancing our society and should be used responsibly with full consideration of the risks. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
