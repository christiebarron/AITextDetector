One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I went to the U.S. Army College Board at Fort Bragg. After my first enlistment, I was stationed as a Ranger and was assigned to Fort Bragg as well as other Army Air Corps bases around the country. After I passed my first exam, I was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and my command felt the right to make me my instructor. I was immediately promoted to Sergeant and I now have a full-time job.


In the last six years since I joined the rank-and-file military in the Army, I have been an invaluable participant in countless lives.


I would like to thank you for your kind words, generous advice and patience.

Thank you so very much for your support

Don't forget this letter with your family and friends.
