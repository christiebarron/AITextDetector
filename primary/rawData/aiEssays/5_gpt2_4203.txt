The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has led to some awkward debates. One participant took aim at its content. "Why don't you just say you're sorry and then you can give us a 'what-if?'" he asked, in reference to a scenario in which a writer might not make the same point over and over again. 'You'd have to change the setting,' he replied cryptically. "I'm not sure what that would lead to."

One writer, whose name, unfortunately, had not been published as a final product of the memoir, went further. "I'm sorry for your feelings," he said. "You may have been surprised how much support I got from people over the years… We talked about this, on a regular basis." The sentiment was echoed by a second writer, who agreed. "I have no regrets, to the great extent of my life; there is a lot more to it. "We had a lovely conversation about this on the phone, and I said it was OK. "I wish I'd met someone else a little differently."

As we enter 'From Home is', the book is getting a bad rep. In the months that followed, the book was on Amazon with a modest 10% sale, which is far from ideal. But it can't help but end up overpriced. For that matter, in recent weeks the price of each novel has gone from over £60 to almost £200.
