In recent years, censorship in libraries has become a serious issue. Stories have circulated about certain works being pulled from shelves, books and movies being labeled as “inappropriate” and libraries instituting age limits for access to certain materials. But when it comes to censorship in libraries, our society needs to take a step back and think about the implications.

First of all, we must recognize that libraries are public spaces open for the consumption and enjoyment of knowledge. They should be places where individuals can explore books, magazines, and movies without fear of judgment or censorship. Removing books from shelves due to their content, no matter how offensive some may find it, is a direct violation of the freedom of expression. Not only does it restrict access to that material, it also restricts the freedom of individuals to make their own decisions about what they read and watch.

In addition, censorship often leads to a narrowing of discourse. By trying to protect people from certain ideas and topics, we limit their exposure to a variety of views which could lead to a decrease in critical thinking. Without access to a variety of materials, individuals cannot form their own opinions on important historical or contemporary issues.

Finally, libraries must consider that the nature of censorship itself is subjective. What one individual may find offensive, another may find informative or interesting. If libraries decide to start censoring certain works, they should have a clear and transparent system in place that is free from bias.
