I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a serious issue facing the region, as is censorship of any other topic."

As for the idea of censorship for academic debate, he said: "As far as I am aware, censorship of literature is not a problem in the North Korean realm, although I don't see censorship of 'critical research' as the only type of activity as per state policy.

We will work to see no censorship whatsoever with our citizens to ensure that they get a fair voice in making their opinion public."
