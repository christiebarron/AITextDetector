If he wants to drive down roads on his own (that is, he has to take an extra turn when stopping suddenly), there is no difference in performance from one speed to the other.

If he wants to go on a straight road at 60 km/h (62km/h or 50km/h on a full speed motorcycle) as a rider â€“ he has to take an extra 6 stops off his time, when he turns off his bike to go down the street.

While we know that there is an advantage if you ride less, there is less risk of injury over the years. Even at the best of times, there are still some risks to be taken.
