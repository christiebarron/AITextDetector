As a long-time reader of your publication, I’d like to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe computers have both positive and negative effects on us and our society — and it’s important to consider these carefully before taking a stance.

They enable us to communicate instantly, get instant access to a world of information, and make complex calculations in the blink of an eye. As a result, people are able to increase their productivity and gain an unprecedented level of access to data and resources.
