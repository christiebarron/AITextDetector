Rather, they should provide access to an array of materials from which patrons can make informed decisions about their own interests and preferences. 

In this sense, censorship in libraries can be seen as antithetical to the mission of libraries, which is to provide information to their patrons. If materials are removed from library shelves due to their offensive nature, then access is limited to the same types of materials and ideas. This fosters an environment that excludes and marginalizes certain points of view— ironically, in an establishment that is meant to support and celebrate diverse ideas and perspectives.

For example, libraries can provide access to material through interlibrary loans or digital resources, while limiting physical access to the restricted material. This ensures that patrons have access to the material without it being present in the library’s physical space.

Ultimately, libraries should remain unbiased sources of information for people of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs. Censorship of library materials could lead to an environment of regressive thought and an undermining of the great strides that we have made towards diversity and inclusion in our libraries.
