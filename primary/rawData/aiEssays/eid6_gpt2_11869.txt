Second, they simply had to install a special cable to connect the building's power poles (to make it possible for fans to pass through the wall from multiple cables on a cable pole through which the building is connected), a problem in the original designs, and an additional problem with the original electrical systems. Third, no cables had been wired together, so even installing electric wires would have been tricky.
