The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many owners objected to being pushed back to accommodate older models but were granted permission for their cars on their lot.

"We had to come up with something that will let the car dock," said Greg McAllister, a resident of Eustis, who owns the property to be built. "There are quite a few owners and they all agreed on the width of the truck." He says his truck has a long, curved roofline giving it excellent view of the city."
