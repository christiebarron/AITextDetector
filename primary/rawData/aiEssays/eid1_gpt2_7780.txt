Computers have many effects on people. A great example to my point is when you try to talk with someone to make a computer run in DOS mode and they will say it will open Windows and ask you to open it. Even without opening DOS, that person might run "Win7", they'd not be even aware they were running a tool like windows. So what happens is the program is run in DOS mode but in Windows it's not. The program's program execution is the same and you simply do what you need to do to ensure a machine is run in DOS mode. So I think this is just a direct effect of my talk from the internet.

A second point I think people ought to make is make more money. One of the arguments I make is that if people can afford computers they can afford being able to run more powerful programs. That is a false argument because I think in the last decade we've already reached a tipping point where people can afford those computers and I think the next step is to take what Microsoft has done to Microsoft and to invest more over the next several years into building more powerful Windows 10, even more powerful Windows 10 for people who would otherwise run DOS machines in DOS mode.

DARON MATÃ‰: Just so I know, I think the most important thing that we'll come back to is I think it's quite difficult to imagine many people ever having any desire to go do something that would have actually taken forever or even longer to
