By ending the poem in this way, it ties together the two major themes of the poem: the frosty winter season and the narrator's educational dreams. In this way, the narrator frames their educational progress with the changes that occur within nature due to the changing of the seasons. This image encourages the reader to contemplate growth, change, and progress, both in terms of the narrator's own educational goals and the natural world. Furthermore, the reference to the 'test again' suggests that this is an ongoing process and emphasizes the idea of learning as a cyclical process.
