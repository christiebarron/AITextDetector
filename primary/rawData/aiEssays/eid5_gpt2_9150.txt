The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' could have been more pleasant had it not been for the fact that my aunt, Margaret, had her daughter, Princess Mary, who has been married to Prince Edward. I must say that I never knew her. If she has come up to my house now, it is a very nice gift from her. But when my aunt, however, was married, nothing seemed to have happened, although her mother had been busy and at her wedding. The same is true of their eldest son, Prince Edward.

I remember I once wondered whether my first wife, Margaret, loved me. It is a pity. But the fact is most people cannot see how much it matters to me. I used to think what she did really hurt me. She was quite good at it; I would laugh at her if she had really gone as a poor lady. Then came her very ill-health, and then the last time she spoke at a funeral. When I was growing up, her health was too gravelly, and she took me to St Petersburg and spent her long evenings with us until we left the capital once a week.

All the ladies at my school loved me. There was nothing nice on my terms. Most people took me to dinner after school and then said to me, "It's all good, your good looks are good enough." Of course I hated her because she treated me like nothing else and I had nothing to take
