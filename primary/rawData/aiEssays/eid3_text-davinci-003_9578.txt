In Joe Kurmaski's poem "Rough Road Ahead", the features of the setting are integral to the story.The gritty and unwelcoming nature of the setting serves to create a sense of anticipation and tension for the cyclist as they traverse this barren and grueling landscape. The cyclist is faced with a long road ahead of them, one with no end in sight and an unforgiving terrain that will leave them feeling physically and emotionally exhausted. 

The rolling hills and rock-hard trail that the cyclist is forced to traverse serve to illustrate the difficult and isolating physical struggle that they face as they attempt to make their way to the destination. The lack of any vegetation or verdant green is a stark reminder that both help and rest are in short supply, and the cyclist has only themselves and the power of their own strength to make it to the end. 

The wind that is described in the poem serves both to push the cyclist forward and wear them down at the same time, becoming an ever-present force that both threatens and encourages them to push on. The heat of the sun combined with the arid and dry landscape make for an uncomfortable and draining environment that the cyclist must contend with as they travel. 

Ultimately, these features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" serve to create an atmosphere of desperation and urgency for the cyclist. From the lack of vegetation and the heat of the sun to the relentless wind that pushes them forward,
