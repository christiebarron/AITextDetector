Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is an exploration of identity, specifically through the lens of home. Through exploring his home in his native Puerto Rico, he uncovers an emotional landscape filled with nostalgia and melancholia, an almost tangible presence of absence. Even in the face of celebrating memories and discovering stories from the past, one can’t help but feel the emptiness of something lost that can’t be regained.

The mood of the memoir is imbued with nostalgia as Rodriguez muses on the meaning of home. Home is not simply a physical place, but rather an identity forged over decades of shared stories and experiences. Each new discovery in the memoir is not just an observation of the physical world, but a reflection of Rodriguez’s own ongoing identity as a Puerto Rican. His exploration of home exposes a distinct sense of longing, one that is difficult to communicate yet easy to feel.

Rodriguez’s writing takes on a sort of dreamlike quality as he reflects on his memories of home. This places the reader within a feeling of suspended time, part of a history filled with stories and memories that will never quite reach resolution. His exploration also reveals a deep connection to home, a sense of security and a homecoming that is a source of comfort and joy even in its stories of loss.

The mood of Rodriguez’s memoir is both melancholic and celebratory
