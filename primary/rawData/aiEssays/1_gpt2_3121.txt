Computers have many effects on people. Many of them were in the making for hundreds of years," says Bambata. "We are here today for a very important mission. We have to look for a way to make computers work better."

Now, Bambata and his team have found a way to get them to work better. They developed aAutomation platform to help users manage their computers. By automating the process of moving files between computers a file named, say, NTFS, could be moved in one piece from one to another without moving them in the whole computer. The project calls this process automation. A machine needs a certain amount of time to perform its job – some computations will take six hours – and no more than 20 milliseconds. Once this is done, it uses the network of servers and hardware to move the files. If no computer is left available, the computer runs itself – the computer will now be an automated machine, as opposed to it being an automated machine that could actually be used.

In order for NTFS to work, the network has to be constantly changing. What's more, NTFS doesn't need to be done by anyone, so when the computer itself stops working it can move back again in real time, like in a car. So, if the computer needs to stop some time after it has stopped working, it can do it just by.:
