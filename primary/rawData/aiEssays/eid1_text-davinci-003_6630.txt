As a part of the modern world, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to imagine life without computers. Computers have had a major influence in virtually every sector of our lives, from education to entertainment, and it’s not always easy to determine if their presence has been positive or negative. In my opinion, computers have had a beneficial effect on people’s lives.

To start, computers have allowed us access to limitless resources of information. No longer do we have to spend hours in libraries going through stacks of books to find the answers to our questions. Instead, we can simply type a few words in a search engine and the answers we need are quickly presented. For students or anyone who needs to research a particular topic, this is incredibly useful and lets us find information more quickly than ever before.

While in the past, a message taking days, weeks or even months to deliver would have been ironical, today the same process takes seconds—all thanks to computers. They’ve made it easier for people to stay in contact with friends, family and colleagues who may be located overseas or in different parts of a country. This has also facilitated collaboration and networking opportunities, allowing people all over the world to work together and benefit from knowledge-sharing.
