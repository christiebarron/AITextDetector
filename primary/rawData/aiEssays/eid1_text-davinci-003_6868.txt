Libraries are places of knowledge and education and should not be subject to censorship. In a world where most of the population has easy access to a vast array of news and information, library materials should not be censored just for being controversial. 

In some cases, such as when material is deemed to be extremely explicit or offensive, it is understandable for libraries to take measures in order to protect minors. However, censoring material from the shelves should never be the primary option. Instead, libraries should be encouraged to implement age restrictions and parental advisories, as well as ensure that all library patrons are aware of the possible offensive nature of certain materials. 

Censorship erodes public access to information and interferes with an individual's right to free speech. This corresponds with the concept of intellectual freedom, which is highly valued in libraries. Restricting certain materials prohibits library patrons from finding and exploring diverse opinions and ideas from various perspectives. It also inhibits creativity and can ultimately harm the community as a whole. The American Library Association has provided guidance for libraries and their materials, stating that the “library is not an instrument of censorship” and that library materials should not be filtered or screened. 

Within reason, people should have the right to express themselves without fear of potential consequences. Removing certain materials from library shelves should never be the only option for dealing with a controversial topic. Libraries should instead focus on providing the most accurate, diverse, and comprehensive information possible
