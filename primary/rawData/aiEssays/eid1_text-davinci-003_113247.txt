To The Editor, 

As a concerned citizen and tech enthusiast, I feel compelled to write to you in regards to the ongoing debate about the effects of computers on people. While many feel that computers can have a negative impact, I strongly believe that computers are a net positive in our society.

It is true that computers can lead to people feeling more isolated from others. When we spend too much time on computers, our relationships suffer and we may become more detached from reality. However, when used responsibly, computers can be a wonderful asset to our lives. 

For example, computers have allowed us to stay connected with our loved ones at virtually any time. We can form relationships with people from all over the world and be informed about current events through international media outlets. In business, computers are a powerful tool that allow us to quickly send and receive information to other companies. 

Overall, I believe that computers can help improve the quality of our lives if used correctly. I encourage your readers to use computers responsibly, so that they can get the most out of this incredible technology.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
