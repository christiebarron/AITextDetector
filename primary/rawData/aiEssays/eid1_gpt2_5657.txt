Computers have many effects on people. When computers have a large number of processes in production or a large volume of RAM, the system has to run at its maximum rate. This will mean that the CPU will run at a much slower rate, which will likely cause the CPU to do more work. That means that the CPU has to spend more time solving mathematical problems. It also means that the CPU's ability to complete tasks to the max will increase.

When calculating the CPU cost to run a computation then we need to ask, how much money is added on the bottom line. If the total amount of RAM is multiplied by the cost of running the whole computation by 100 and the cost of running a system then the computer will make up the following cost to run the computation:

CPU: 100/10 The GPU: 20% This means that if a GPU was needed, the GPU would actually require a lot of RAM to run efficiently. At higher clocks, if this amount of RAM is added then the system will have a bigger power budget. Therefore you must be careful not to over-optimize the CPU which could lead to overheating. Since there are many CPU costs, you usually don't want to over-optimize the cost of a particular process (for example, over-processing may cause overheating). In fact, if the GPU cost is reduced by a factor of one then the system would be slower. Therefore the cost of over-processing is usually calculated using
