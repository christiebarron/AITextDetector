Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects of computers on people. Computers have become commonplace, with the potential to affect how people carry out their daily lives. In my opinion, the implications of computers for people are positive.

The accessibility of technology has opened up a world of knowledge to those who may have previously had challenging economic or geographic barriers to accessing information. With the cost of computer hardware, software, and broadband access becoming more affordable, this “knowledge potential” is accessible to the majority. This means that the average person can access information, educational content, and other resources to help them develop a deeper understanding of a given subject. This potential can also help people develop their careers, by providing online training and knowledge.

Computers can also provide an avenue to connect with like-minded people and foster meaningful connections. The ubiquity of the internet has enabled people to form relationships with those who share the same interests and values that would be otherwise impossible to obtain using traditional means. Additionally, computers can be used for recreation and fun. Through online gaming and streaming platforms, people can now experience a massive variety of entertainment which is constantly being updated and improved.

I believe the effects of computers on people are overwhelmingly beneficial. They can dramatically increase the quality and breadth of our lives, both in terms of knowledge and relationships. I urge your readers to make the most out of this potential, as computers will undoubtedly shape our future for the better.
