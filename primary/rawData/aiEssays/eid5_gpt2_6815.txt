The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has brought forth a sense of hope, as the two are joined by the singer, guitarist and drummer to offer a more candid critique.

'I love what I read about being out in London or in the United States. It has been a big step for me to go 'out there all the time, make it a point to be on the same page' but you're right to ask yourself if anyone else wants to come back to that life with some self expression or even a new sense of self, as they do this year,' says Gershon.

'It's not what you think â€” it's what happens at a very young age... you want to live a life that you'll be able to support and to do something about, and still enjoy that life and not get stuck in that part of my life or keep that life stuck in the 'one person one click' time-zone.'

The recording is due to be recorded in New York and premiered on Sunday, March 26, so hopefully a good few of the young musicians who will be recording it will be coming out of London for the second time.
