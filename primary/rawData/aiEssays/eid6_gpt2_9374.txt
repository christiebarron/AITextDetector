The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For safety reasons, they decided to add a separate type of conveyor belt to the building that could be attached to the elevator.

While a common design for those time frames has often been used for the elevator, many people believe that their use for the building was also at odds with the design for the other building blocks.

"It's the second major example of what we considered unacceptable design," said Dolan of the Los Angeles Times. "The design was to cut down on this kind of structural integrity and make sure nobody could possibly move in either direction at a high speed. The first problem was that the stair system on that building was so small compared to other buildings in the whole system, they didn't have the proper safety restraints for the floors."

The stair system was used because other elevators were considered to have relatively similar building conditions and were a safe solution to the problems of the elevator. The elevator would simply float in the water (see chart below) without needing to be placed over water because of safety. The "giant" system was never added because of this.

Still, Dolan said he does not like people using elevator elevators on skyscrapers for reasons that would not come from a design of theirs.

On a couple of occasions when he and some of the engineers at the California Department of Transportation (DOT) were asked about the
