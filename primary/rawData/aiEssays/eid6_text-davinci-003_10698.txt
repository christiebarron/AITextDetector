The Empire State Building was completed in 1931 and included a mooring mast, extending 200 feet off its roof, designed to allow the new lighter-than-air aircraft, dirigibles, to dock in the heart of Manhattan. Unfortunately, this remarkable structure faced a number of obstacles that helped prevent it from fulfilling its intended purpose.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the physical structure of the building itself. The mooring mast was not heavy-duty enough to withstand the powerful gusts and strong winds that could hit the top of the building. The structure also had to be tall enough to allow for a safe landing point for an approaching airship; this required the engineers to build a mast that was an additional 200 feet above the roofline.

The second obstacle was the technological limitations of the early 20th century. In order to dock a large airship on a building, the engineers had to get creative with their engineering. Airships require a rigid system of wires and cables that can keep the airship in place; these had to be designed and implemented around the typical hazards of a sky-high Manhattan building, like high winds. The cables were also not strong enough to keep the airships from swaying in the wind or to compensate for their immense weight.

The third obstacle was the lack of a landing pad specifically designed for mooring. Instead, the mooring mast had to be outfitted with a large
