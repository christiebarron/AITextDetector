One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I lost my parents, and what happened to my life, and all my friends and family lost their lives. There's people who are hurt as a result of what we've done, but, like what my mom did, what my dad did. I want people to just think, "OK, maybe this is not something that's so much important â€” maybe it's just something that I never saw because I was that way."

I want people to look at our legacy. I want people to start looking at the history of us and begin thinking about what we've done.
