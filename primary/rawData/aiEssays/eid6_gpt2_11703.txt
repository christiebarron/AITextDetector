The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The earliest in the history of the building, which saw the opening of the Manhattan subway line and eventually opened Brooklyn Bridge for the first time, was the first time any dirigible was powered by solar panels.

In 1963 the Empire State building went up for a demolition vote, but a new one went down in 1967 with construction of the John Street, an 11-bed apartment complex. The building's roof had the roof off before it got built, but the roof fell off in August 1969, so there was no more roofing required. At that point, the Empire State became a ghost town by the late 1980's, when it underwent a major renovation, and there are few people still living there.

The Empire State Building's second sister building, the Empire State Building, which is still standing today, still has a lot to offer. It had its own apartment complex at the time and also housed a new state building that was originally about to be demolished. The Empire State Building's future at the Brooklyn Borough of New York is uncertain, but it has certainly provided the building with many opportunities, especially in places such as Manhattan's Jamaica Plain to get a taste of the Empire State's charm and history.
