The construction of the Empire State Building in the early 1930s was a monumental engineering feat that many thought was impossible at the time. One of the most ambitious designs included in the plans for the building was a docking station for dirigibles, or large airships, at the top of the building. However, this was no easy feat and presented a serious challenge to the builders of the Empire State Building.

The main obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the weight of the dirigibles. Airships of the time were much heavier than modern-day airplanes, and they couldn’t be allowed to land on the roof of the building for fear of damaging it. To solve this problem, building engineer Severud designed a system of mooring cables to support the weight of the dirigibles. The cables were extended outward from the building and attached to a sturdy mooring mast at the top. This enabled dirigibles to safely land and be securely fastened to the top of the building. 

In addition to the problem of weight, the builders also needed to consider the safety of the passengers and crew of these dirigibles. To make sure they would have a safe and comfortable trip, engineers constructed a 100-foot-long tunnel to connect the mooring mast to the interior of the building. This tunnel was designed to be air-tight and was to be filled with air from the dirigible’s tanks in order
