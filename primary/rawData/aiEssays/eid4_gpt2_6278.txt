The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it says the reader and the world, which already seems to be on the brink of collapse, are at loggerheads. "The author's point is that the real reason for this is to maintain continuity, while at the same time setting up the question in the minds of those who look the other way, namely: 'There's no good way—no way at all—you can be here at all, in all the world!'"

"I don't see why we should ever be able to be here, it's not like we're ever going anywhere. But if people are going to give us something and say that the world has changed, we need at least to find a way for new life to take its place and replace it. At some point that's going to be our turn. The world needs change, but when we're gone, it just won't last. I'm optimistic."

In the end, Hibiscus' book ends up like a broken egg: a story about a family that has grown into a small but successful business, where the two are all friends and have a very well-earned sense of personal responsibility and loyalty, despite the constant threat of having to walk the walk.
