To The Editor,

In the past several decades, the use of computers has become an integral part of our lives. Computers make it easier to accomplish tasks, save time, and even expand our knowledge. However, I strongly believe that computers can have a detrimental effect on people if used inappropriately.

The use of technology, including computers, can diminish creative thinking. As computers are used to do tedious tasks that require little thought or skill, our brains become less involved in those activities and we become less likely to use our brain to come up with creative solutions. This can have a direct impact on our daily lives as critical problem solving and innovative thinking may become more difficult.

In addition, computers can lead to a disconnect between people, which can be emotionally damaging. When people are spending a large amount of time in front of computers, instead of interacting with others in a face-to-face capacity, it can lead to a lack of true connection between individuals. This in turn can lead to people feeling lonely, isolated, and disconnected from the world.

Overall, computers have the potential to be useful tools, but their heavy use can lead to negative consequences. I urge readers to be mindful of the amount of time they spend on computers and be sure to foster meaningful connections with people in their day-to-day lives.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
