The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some of the original equipment needed to build the building had been sold at auction, and a number of other military structures later were used by individuals. The Pentagon's decision to use a single laser-guided missile in the early 1950s as the main tool for the production of dirigibles also resulted in the creation of the Advanced Technology Research and Development Center (ATSRC), which is dedicated exclusively to developing, manufacturing and selling the military's new technology. The building was placed into "autocar port" status for the first time in March 1959, and the ATSRC's mission was to advance this technology through several stages.

The ATSRC built and used a laser-guided missile against one of the primary targets. The missile was capable of striking from 25,000 feet (10,000 meters, depending on the level of force applied.) In 1958, the government awarded the ATSRC an additional five thousand hours' work per year (OTC) in order to make sure the technology remained effective over 100 years. The ATC included a special program for the United States of ATSRC to develop a second missile. This program included three prototype missiles and a weaponized fighter. The final ATSRC missile was the A8N-200C1. There are several versions of this missile with each variant having its own unique characteristics and a unique layout such as the "new"
