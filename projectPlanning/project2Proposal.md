# Project 2 Proposal DRAFT

datasources to extract:
- beautiful soup: get human-written text from wherever website we want
- hugging face to generate more AI text perhaps?
- OR, beautiful soup to scrape AI text if we can find a dedicated place with AI text
- OR, if there's somehow a SQL server we can connect to with human/AI writing we can use that instead. get data w/ SQL query.

Transformation:
- do similar data wrangling to the first time around, to add the text to the pipeline
- transform so its suitable for uploading to SQL or NoSQL.
- if create a flask app, transform/organize so usable for flask

Load
- create SQL or NoSQL database with 1) the writing, 2) the processed features
- if create a flask app, provide it there.
