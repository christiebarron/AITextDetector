## Introduction

This repository contains a project to 1) develop an application that will 
use a large language model to automatically write text and 2) an 
application that identifies AI-generated written text. 

The goal of this project is to develop a basic filter model as part of a larger NLP pipeline for the automated scoring of student essays.

## Folder structure

- asapData: contains all of the code and data we are using for the NLP pipeline. Refer to this to see all work completed for project 1.

    - asapData/scripts: contains all of the python and jupyter notebook scripts we used to create the NLP pipeline. 
    - asapData/rawData: contains all of the original data (excel documents and text files) prior to processing. 
    - asapData/cleanData: contains all of the processed data.
    - asapData/output: contains all figures, tables, and other output from analyses.
    - asapData/documentation: contains documentation for the NLP pipeline.
    
- projectPlanning: contains documents related to project management and planning.
     
- archive: contains files that are no longer relevant. 

- templates: contains highly-performing and highly-rated example templates *not written by us* designed for 1) automated *scoring* of the ASAP student response data and 2) to identify machine-generated text using a different dataset. These files were just used for idea generation.
